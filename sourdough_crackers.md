## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In mixer bowl, whisk together salt and flour. Add sourdough discard and olive oil. Optionally, heavier seasonings may be added to the dough at this stage. Combine with spatula until the dough comes together.
3. Continue to knead in mixer with dough hook until the dough forms a smooth ball. Divide into quarters. Lay a piece of parchment paper on full size sheetpan.
4. Using pasta roller with a dough ball, progressively flatten to setting 4 and transfer to parchment paper. Repeat with remaining dough.
4. Brush the dough with olive oil, then top with light seasonings, as desired. For heavier seasonings, brush the surface of the dough with a beaten egg white instead of oil, then scatter the toppings and press them in gently.
