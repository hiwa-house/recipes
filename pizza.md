A bastardized hybrid of Sicilian and Detroit-style pizzas with a pinch of Domino's pan pizza thrown in for good measure.

## info
* About 10 hours
* 2x	10.5" cast iron pan pizzas (360g each)

## ingredients
**Overall Formula**
```
100%	Flour
76%	Water
1.8%	Salt
2.0%	Extra Virgin Olive Oil
0.5%	Malt Powder (optional)

0.14	Dough Loading/Thickness (total dough weight divided by pan area)
```
**Levain**
```
31	grams	Flour
31	grams	Water
16	grams	Sourdough Starter
```
**Final Dough**
```
360	grams	Flour
266	grams	Water (87°F)
7	grams	Salt
2	grams	Malt Powder (optional)
8	grams	Extra Virgin Olive Oil
78	grams	Levain
```

## steps
1. **Prepare the levain:** About 12 hours before you mix the dough, combine the levain ingredients and leave to ferment on the counter.

2. For same day pizza, begin following next steps about 10 hours before you want to eat.

3. **Mix the dough:** Combine flour, water, salt, malt powder, and levain in mixing bowl and mix with a dough hook on low speed until ingredients are fully mixed (about 2 minutes). Increase mixer to speed 2 and mix for 5 minutes more. Let dough rest uncovered for 10 minutes. Turn mixer to low speed again and slowly drizzle oil into bowl. When oil is fully incorporated, increase to speed 2 and continue mixing until dough pulls cleanly from the bowl (about 15 minutes). Desired dough temperature at the end of mixing should be 70-75°F.

4. **Bulk Fermentation:** Transfer dough to oiled, medium bowl, cover, and allow to ferment for 2 hours total at 76°F. Every 30 minutes during fermentation, perform a stretch and fold:

	Dip your hand briefly in a bowl of water, then shake off the excess. Using one hand, scoop your fingers under one side of the dough to the very bottom of the bowl and, working quickly, lift that side, stretch it a few inches, and fold it over to the opposite side. Rotate the bowl and repeat, 4 to 6 times, until you’ve worked all the way around the dough. (The dough will become noticeably tighter and a little more difficult to stretch with each fold.)

5. **Shaping:** Pour 1 tablespoon oil in the bottom of each cast iron skillet and spread oil on bottom and sides of the skillets. Divide the dough and place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn to coat evenly with oil. Cover the skillets with foil or plastic wrap and allow the dough to proof about 6 hours at 76°F.

6. **Proofing:** During this proofing, every 30 minutes, use your fingertips to press it around, gently stretching towards the pan edges. Lift up the edges of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape. Repeat this stretching until the dough fills the pan, then don't touch it anymore, and let it do its thing. When the crust is ready for baking, it should be marshmallow soft and poofy.

7. **Heat the oven:** About 60 minutes before baking, adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat your oven to 500°F (or as high as it will go).

8. **Bake the pizzas:** When crust is ready, top each with tomato sauce. Par-bake the crusts for about 8 minutes, or until they are just starting to color. Remove skillets from the oven and add the rest of the toppings. When adding cheese, make sure it covers the crust all the way to the skillet sides.

	Transfer skillets to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom is golden brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan over a burner and cook on medium heat, moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Immediately sprinkle with grated Parmesan, if using. Transfer pizzas to a cutting board. Cut each pizza into 6 slices and serve immediately.

## notes
* Increase bulk fermentation and proofing steps by 1-2 hours each if your ambient temperature is 72°F or below.
* Malt powder is optional. Added to slightly improve crust browning.
* Typical dough loading/thickness: NY-0.10, Sicilian-0.12, Detroit-0.16
* Expensive pans, but worth the cost for consistent results: https://lloydpans.com/sicilian-style-pizza-pans.html
