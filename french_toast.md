## info  
* About 25 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## ingredients  
```
3	large	eggs
1	tablespoon	packed brown sugar, plus more for sprinkling
¼	teaspoon	table salt
½	teaspoon	ground cinnamon
¼	teaspoon	freshly grated nutmeg
2	teaspoons	vanilla extract
1	cup	milk
8	slices	hearty white sandwich bread
2	tablespoons	unsalted butter for the pan, plus more for serving
Maple syrup and fruit compote, for serving
```

## steps  
1. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200°F. If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.
3. Pour egg mixture into prepared sheet. Arrange bread in single layer in egg mixture, leaving small gaps between slices. Working quickly, use your fingers to flip slices in same order you placed them in sheet. Let sit until slices absorb remaining custard, about 1 minute.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon butter on griddle over medium-low heat, until foaming subsides. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to the rack in the oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.
5. Serve French toast with pats of butter and maple syrup.
