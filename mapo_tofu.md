## info

## ingredients  
```
¼–1   teaspoon   Sichuan peppercorns, divided
55 grams virgin rapeseed oil (¼ cup)
8  grams  cornstarch (1 tbsp)
30 mililiters  cold water
1  package   soft or medium tofu, cut into ½-inch cubes (1½ lbs)
120   grams   pork or beef, minced (¼ lb)
3  garlic cloves, minced
1  tablespoon   fresh ginger grated on a microplane grater
2  tablespoons  pickled red peppers, minced
25 grams doubanjiang fermented chili bean paste (2 tbsp)
14 grams fermented black beans, chopped (1 tbsp)
2  tablespoons  chili powder
15 mililiters  Xiaoxing wine (1 tbsp)
15 mililiters  dark soy sauce (1 tbsp)
250   mililiters low-sodium chicken stock or water
¼  teaspoon ground white pepper
¼  cup finely sliced scallion greens
```

## steps  
1. Heat sichuan peppercorns in a large wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Transfer to a mortar and pestle. Pound until finely ground and set aside.
2. Slice tofu in half horizontally. Then, slice down to get strips, and finally cut in the other direction to get cubes. Combine corn starch and cold water in a small bowl and mix with a fork until homogenous.
3. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high heat and add tofu. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat until ready to stir fry.
4. Heat oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of ground sichuan peppercorns. Add minced meat and cook, stirring constantly until meat begins to crisp around edges (1-2 minutes).
5. Lower heat to medium-low. Add garlic, ginger, and pickled red peppers and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add chili-bean paste and cook until oil becomes red, about 90 seconds. Add fermented black beans, chili powder, wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock and bring to a boil.
6. Gently drain water from tofu, being careful not to break up the tofu. Add tofu to wok and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Loosen up the cornstarch slurry. Pour one-third of corn starch mixture into the sauce and cook for 30 seconds until thickened, stirring gently. Repeat with remaining thirds of slurry.
8. Transfer immediately to a serving bowl and sprinkle with white pepper, scallions, and remaining toasted ground Sichuan pepper. Serve immediately with white rice.
