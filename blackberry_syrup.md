# Blackberry Syrup  

## info  
* About 3 hours (including 2 hours to macerate)  
* 650 grams/pint  

## ingredients  
```
100%  Blackberries
40%   Granulated Sugar
0.2%  Salt
30  mililiter Lemon Juice
1 teaspoon  Elderflower Liqueur
```

## steps  
1. Combine sugar and berries in a heavy-bottomed pot. Let macerate for at least 2 hours.  
2. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, continuously stirring and scraping along the bottom and sides of the saucier with a flexible, heat-resistant spatula. This should take about 5 minutes; if it seems to be moving too slowly, simply increase the heat.  
3. Remove from heat and use an immersion blender in the pot to blend the berries. Strain the syrup through a metal sieve placed over a second pot.  
4. Add lemon juice to syrup and continue cooking over medium heat. When the syrup reaches 216Â°F, remove from heat.  
5. Stir in the elderflower liqueur and transfer syrup to half-pint jars. Refrigerate and use within a month, or freeze for six months.
