## steps  
1. Combine onion, Asian pear, kiwi, garlic, and ginger in a blender and process to a coarse purée, scraping down sides of blender as needed, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and whisk together with gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, mirin, sesame oil, and black pepper.

2. Place pork and green onions in a gallon zipper-lock bag or large baking dish, and pour marinade over the meat. Toss to evenly distribute the marinade, then seal bag, removing as much air as possible (if using baking dish, wrap tightly with plastic wrap). Transfer pork to refrigerator, and marinate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.

3. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, place wire rack on top of grill grate over the coals, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the wire rack set over the grill grate.

4. Grill pork directly over the hot side of the grill. If using a charcoal grill, leave uncovered; if using a gas grill, cover. Cook, turning occasionally, until pork is cooked through and lightly charred on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer to a serving platter.

5. **For Serving:** Sprinkle pork with sesame seeds and serve immediately, passing ssamjang, lettuces, garnishes, and banchan at the table.
