# Sauerkraut  


## info  
* About 3 hours (2.5 weeks fermenting)  
* 3200 grams per crock  

## ingredients  
```
100%  head  kraut cabbage, trimmed, cored, and shredded, outer leaves reserved
2% salt, plus more as needed
0.3%  caraway seeds or juniper berries (optional; see note)
```

## steps  
1. Add shredded cabbage to large mixing bowl or other container, sprinkling in the measured salt and optional spices as you go. Mix well, then knead and squeeze cabbage for a few minutes to begin to release its liquid.
2. Covering cabbage between kneadings with a towel, continue to squeeze and knead cabbage roughly every 15 minutes, until an ample amount of brine has formed; it should be enough to cover the cabbage when the cabbage is compressed. This can take up to 2 hours. If not enough brine forms, proceed to the next step.
3. Lay reserved cabbage leaves on top of cabbage and press down until brine rises 1/2 to 1 inch above cabbage. Add stone or glass weights and push down to compress even more. If there is not enough brine, top it up with a 2% salt solution. (You can make this by dissolving 2 grams of salt in 100 grams of water.)
4. Seal fermentation crock. Put in a cool, dark place; 65 to 70°F (18 to 21°C) is ideal. After a day or two (or three), the fermentation process should kick off more actively and the cabbage should be bubbling away. If the vessel is quite full, it's best to put a rimmed baking sheet under it to catch any overflowing fluids.
5. After the first week, open vessel, push cabbage back down below brine level, and taste cabbage to monitor its progress. If brine gets low, top it up with more 2% salt water. If mold grows on the surface, carefully scrape it off and continue to ferment the kraut.
6. The sauerkraut is ready when it is quite sour, which can take anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks, depending on your preference. Throw out the sauerkraut if it becomes discolored, slimy, or malodorous. (Some sulfurous smell is natural, but anything truly offensive is a bad sign.) Refrigerate in sealed containers for up to 6 months. 

## notes  
* Caraway will give you a more German-style kraut, while juniper will give you a more Alsatian style. You can also omit the spices.  
* Aged 17 days (2021).  
* ~454 grams fresh cabbage per quart of finished kraut.
