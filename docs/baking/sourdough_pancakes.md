Supplemental description.  

## ℹ️ info
* About 40 minutes  
* 16 4-inch pancakes  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **212	grams**	all-purpose flour *(1 1/2 c)*
- [ ] **25	grams**	sugar *(2 tbsp)*
- [ ] **1	teaspoon**	baking powder
- [ ] **3/4	teaspoon**	baking soda
- [ ] **1	teaspoon**	kosher salt
- [ ] **2	large**	eggs
- [ ] **63	grams**	unsalted butter *(1/4 c)*
- [ ] **240	grams**	sourdough discard *(1 c)*
- [ ] **240	grams**	milk *(1 c)*
- [ ] **1/2	teaspoon**	vanilla extract
- [ ] **1	teaspoon**	vegetable oil

## 🔪 steps
1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk eggs and butter in second medium bowl until well combined. Whisk sourdough discard, milk, and vanilla into egg mixture. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.
2. Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil on griddle over medium-low heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, wipe out oil, leaving thin film on griddle. Drop 1 tablespoon batter in center of skillet. If flapjack is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly.
3. Using 2-ounce ladle or 1/3-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving 2 inches between portions. If necessary, gently spread batter into 4-inch rounds. Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil as necessary.


## ✏️ notes
* Add up to 1 cup of sweet potato or pumpkin to batter.
