## ℹ️ info
* About 45 minutes  
* 2 dozen  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **115	grams**	unsalted butter, melted
- [ ] **10	grams**	vanilla extract
- [ ] **50	grams**	egg
- [ ] **150	grams**	light brown sugar
- [ ] **50	grams**	granulated sugar
- [ ] **2	grams**	Diamond Crystal kosher salt

- [ ] **3	grams**	baking soda
- [ ] **200	grams**	rolled oats
- [ ] **120	grams**	all-purpose flour
- [ ] **120	grams**	raisins 

## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position, preheat to 350°F, and line 2 aluminum half sheet pans with parchment paper.
2. Combine butter, vanilla, egg, brown sugar, white sugar, kosher salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Stir until no lumps remain, then fold in rolled oats, followed by the flour and raisins. Divide into 30 one-ounce portions with a roughly 2-tablespoon scoop and arrange on prepared sheet pans. Let stand at room temperature for at least 25 minutes, no more than 75.
3. Bake until pale gold around the edges, but still puffed and steamy in the center, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pans until firm, about 10 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature. 

## ✏️ notes
* ***Thumbprint Variation:*** Roll scoops of dough into a ball, and using your thumb or the round end of a small pestle, make a well in the center of each cookie. Using a teaspoon, fill each well with jam, being careful not to overfill the wells.
