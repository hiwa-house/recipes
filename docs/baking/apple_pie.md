## 🔪 steps
1. ***For the Filling:*** Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a gallon-sized zip-top bag (do not add tapioca at this time). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.
2. Measure 1450 grams sliced apples into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost about 240 mililiters of juice, about 75-90 minutes. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.
3. Add tapioca starch to the apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Strain the apples and place into the prepared pie shell, reserving the juice and nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Add 240 mililiters of reserved juice to pie.
4. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design).
5. Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375°F.
6. ***For the Egg Wash:*** Whisk egg, yolk, cream, and salt together in a small bowl, then brush over the chilled pie. With a sharp knife, cut six 3-inch vents around the top, wiggling the blade left and right to open each into a wide vent.
7. ***To Bake:*** Place pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan and bake until 195°F in the very center, about 75 minutes. *If necessary, shield crust with foil to prevent overbrowning.*
8. ***To Serve:*** Cool at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature. Warm in a 350°F oven to restore the crispy crust and saucy filling.
