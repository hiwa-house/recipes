## info  
* About 45 minutes  
* 600 mililiters (20 oz)  

## ingredients  
```
1	can	pumpkin puree (425g), or 15 ounces homemade pumpkin puree
½	can	coconut milk (200ml)
80	grams	light brown sugar (or 100 grams sweetened condensed milk)
½	teaspoon	ground cinnamon
¼	teaspoon	kosher salt
```

## steps  
1. Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan with a whisk and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
2. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered. Cook, stirring frequently, until the kaya is thick and spreadable, about 40 minutes. (A spoon will leave a clean trail in the bottom of the pan.)
3. Allow the pumpkin butter to cool to room temperature. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
