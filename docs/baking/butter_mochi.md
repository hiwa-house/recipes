## 🔪 steps
1.  Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch pan. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, butter, coconut oil, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low to combine, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
2.  With mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. (If using spices, whisk with rice flour.) Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in 1/3 of rice flour, then add 1/3 of liquid ingredients. Repeat with remaining flour and liquid ingredients, working in thirds as before. Finally, add any flavor ingredients, if using.
3.  Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed until everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering around 65°F on a digital thermometer. *(Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems.)*
4.  Scrape into pan, and bake until edges turn golden brown, about 55 minutes or to an internal temperature of 200°F. Cool mochi for completely, then slice and serve.

## ✏️ notes
* Test bake at 375F for 45 minutes instead.
* Freezes very well.
