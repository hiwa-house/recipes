## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Lightly grease muffin tins. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, butter, coconut oil, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low to combine, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
2. With mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in ⅓ of rice flour, then add ⅓ of sour cream. Repeat with remaining flour and sour cream, working in thirds as before.
3. Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for 1 second to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering around 65°F on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)
4. Scrape into prepared muffin tins, filling each one to nearly the top, and sprinkle on the sesame seeds. Bake until edges turn golden brown, about 15-20 minutes or to an internal temperature of 200°F. Cool muffins for 10 minutes, then loosen with a butter knife and remove from pan to wire rack. Let cool to room temperature and serve with coffee or tea.
