Devil's Food cake. Time-tested recipe for D's birthday cakes or cupcakes.  

## ℹ️ info
* About 30 minutes active (3 hours total)
* 2x 9x13 sheet cakes *(1.4x multiplier)*

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **480 grams** unsalted butter
- [ ] **480 grams** brewed black coffee, or black tea such as Assam
- [ ] **120 grams** Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute
- [ ] **240 grams** finely chopped dark chocolate, roughly 72%
- [ ] **640 grams** light brown sugar
- [ ] **21 grams** vanilla extract
- [ ] **6 grams** Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- [ ] **415 grams** eggs, straight from the fridge *(8 large)*
- [ ] **65 grams** egg yolks, straight from the fridge *(4 large)*
- [ ] **360 grams** all-purpose flour
- [ ] **18 grams** baking soda

## 🔪 steps
1. **Getting Ready:** Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 300°F (w/ convection). Line pans with parchment sling and grease with pan spray.
2. **For the Cake:** Combine butter and coffee or tea in a 5-quart stainless steel pot over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat, then mix in cocoa and chocolate, followed by brown sugar, vanilla, and salt. Mix in eggs and yolks, then sift in flour and baking soda. Whisk thoroughly to combine.  
3. Divide batter between prepared cake pans, using about 1360 grams each. Bake until cakes are firm but your finger can still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 30 minutes (a toothpick inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached).
4. Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Lift onto a wire rack with parchment sling. Meanwhile, prepare the buttercream.
5. **For the Crumb Coat:** Level cakes with a serrated knife and set scraps aside for snacking. Place first layer on cake board on top of cake circle. Top first layer with 2 cup frosting, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Place second layer, using cake trimming to level corners if necessary. Cover top and sides of cake with frosting, spreading it as thinly and smoothly as you can.
6. Refrigerate cake until frosting hardens, about 30 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate until ready to apply top coat of frosting.
7. Let cake return to cool room temperature before serving. Under a cake dome or an inverted pot, the frosted cake will keep 24 hours at cool room temperature.

## ✏️ notes
* For 24x Cupcakes: *(0.66x multiplier)*
* For 3x 8-in layer cakes:  *(0.71x multiplier)*
* After mixing, batter can be held at room temperature up to 90 minutes, though the rise will not be quite as high.
* Use a bench scraper to smooth sides evenly.
