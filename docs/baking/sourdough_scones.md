## 🔪 steps
1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In the work bowl of a food processor, place flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt; pulse until combined, about 3 times. Add cold butter, and pulse until mixture is crumbly with some larger pieces of butter remaining, 10 to 12 quick pulses. Turn out dough into a large bowl, and stir in lemon-ginger mix-ins if desired.
3. In a medium bowl, stir together sourdough discard and cream until combined. Add discard mixture to flour mixture, stirring with a dough whisk just until dough comes together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface, and knead a few times until a slightly sticky dough is formed.
4. Gently pat dough into an 8-inch circle, about 1 inch thick. Cut into 8 wedges. Place scones on prepared pan. Brush top of scones with cream, and sprinkle with pearl sugar, if using.
5. Bake until tops and edges are lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on pan for 10 minutes. If using lemon glaze instead of pearl sugar, in a small bowl, whisk together confectioners' sugar and enough lemon juice to make a smooth, thick, pour-able glaze. Brush glaze over warm scones.
6. Serve warm or at room temperature.
