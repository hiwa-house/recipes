- [ ] **120	grams**	almond milk, room temperature

## 🔪 steps
1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the coconut oil, sugar, almond milk, and vanilla extract; whisk thoroughly to combine.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
3. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients; whisk in just until the lumps disappear (be sure not to over mix or else your donuts will be dense).
4. Form dough into a 4-inch round. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Gently roll the chilled dough onto a generously floured board into a circle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut as many donuts and holes as possible, making sure to flour the cutters before each cut. Gently re-roll the scraps and cut more holes. If the dough becomes too soft to handle, put it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
5. Place the cut or rolled donuts on a parchment lined baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until slightly firm if they are too soft to handle.
6. Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat until temperature registers 350°F. Then, turn heat to low to maintain temperature.
7. Add half of the donuts and fry until the bottoms turn golden brown, 1 to 1½ minutes for small donuts and 2 to 2½ minutes for large donuts. Using chopsticks, turn the donuts and fry for until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
8. Transfer doughnuts to a paper towel-lined baking sheet.
9. **For Cinnamon-Sugar Topping:** Stir together the cinnamon and sugar for the topping in a shallow, wide bowl. Toss donuts immediately in the bowl and serve warm.
