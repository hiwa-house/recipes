## 🔪 steps  
1. Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, ube extract, vanilla extract, and baking powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Pause to scrape the bowl with a flexible spatula, then beat a minute more. In chilly winter months, this process may take longer.
2. With the mixer running, crack in the egg, add the ube jam, and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until dough begins to gather around the paddle but the flour hasn't quite disappeared. Fold once or twice with a flexible spatula to ensure the dough is well combined and appears thick and sticky. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.
3. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 325°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
4. Using tablespoon measure, scoop level tablespoon of dough and roll between palms into 1 inch ball; drop ball into cake pan with sugar and repeat to form about 4 balls. Toss balls in sugar to lightly coat, then drop into seperate cake pan with confectioners' sugar and coat very generously. Set balls on prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are browned, still puffy and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. If the cookies aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. Do not over-bake.
6. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes, then use wide metal spatula to transfer cookies to wire rack; cool cookies to room temperature and serve. (Can be stored at room temperature in airtight container or zipper-lock plastic bag up to 5 days.)

## ✏️ notes  
* Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls (that are not coated in confectioners’ sugar) freeze well up to 3 months. See post above about how to freeze cookie dough balls.
