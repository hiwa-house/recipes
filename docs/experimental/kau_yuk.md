## üî™ steps  
1. Sear skin of pork belly until well-browned using a wok over medium-high or placing the pork in a shallow tray of water and torching over 2-3 passes.
2. Rinse pork in a bowl of water and scrape skin clean with a knife or stainless scrubber.
3. Place pork in a pan and cover with water, adding half of ginger, half of green onion, and half of Xiaoxing wine. Bring to a boil, skimming any foam, and cook until chopsticks can be inserted into the skin, about 20 minutes.
4. Transfer pork belly to a bowl of cold water. When cool, slice pork into 2 cm pieces.
5. Heat wok over medium-high heat. Add oil and pork belly. Stir fry until golden brown, emptying any oil that accumulates, about 6 minutes.
6. Add star anise, cinnamon, bay, peppercorns, and remaining ginger to wok. Stir fry with pork belly until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add bean curd and soy sauce to wok and toss until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Add rock sugar, salt, water, and remaining Xiaoxing wine to wok and bring to a boil. Add remaining green onion and eggs and cook at a simmer for 60 minutes.
7. Remove and discard star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, green onion, and ginger. Remove eggs and set aside. Continue cooking until liquid is reduced to a thickened sauce.
8. Serve pork belly and sauce with the peeled eggs over rice.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes
