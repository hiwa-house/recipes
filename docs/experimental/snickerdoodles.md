## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
2. Whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt; set aside. *If making the pumpkin variation, add the nutmeg at this step.*
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine butter and sugar. Mix at low speed to combine, then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and then resume mixing on medium speed. Add eggs and continue beating until smooth. *If making the pumpkin variation, swap 1 egg for the canned pumpkin and add the vanilla extract.* Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and mix to form a stiff dough.
4. Using a #40 disher *(1/2 tbsp)*, divide dough into portions and roll into a ball *(If the dough is too soft, refrigerate for 1 hour before scooping)*. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68°F before baking.
5. Mix sugar with cinnamon in a small bowl. *If making the pumpkin variation, add the allspice at this step.* Tumble each ball of dough in cinnamon sugar until fully coated.
6. Arrange on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, leaving 1 1/2 inches between balls. Bake until beginning to crack, firm around the edges, and just set in the middle, about 10 minutes, rotating halfway through baking.
7. Cool directly on baking sheet until the crumb is set, about 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature.
