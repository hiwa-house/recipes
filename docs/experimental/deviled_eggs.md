## 🔪 steps
1. Add 1 inch of water to medium saucepan, cover and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the saucepan. Cover pan and cook eggs, adjusting the burner to maintain a vigorous boil for 11 minutes. Transfer eggs to a towel and allow them to cool naturally. Alternately, fill medium bowl with 1 quart water and 1 dozen ice cubes. Pour off water from saucepan and gently shake pan back and forth to crack shells. Transfer eggs to ice water with slotted spoon and let cool 5 minutes.

2. Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Transfer yolks to fine-mesh sieve and use spatula to press them through sieve and into bowl. Add remaining ingredients, mashing mixture against sides of bowl until smooth.

3. Arrange whites on serving platter and fill with yolk mixture, mounding filling about 1/2 inch above whites. Serve immediately.

4. ***MAKE AHEAD:*** You can make the deviled eggs up to 2 days ahead. Wrap the peeled egg-white halves tightly with a double layer of plastic wrap and place the filling in a zipper-lock plastic bag (squeezing out all the air). Refrigerate until ready to fill and serve.


## ✏️ notes
* To center the yolks, turn the carton of eggs on its side in the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook the eggs.
