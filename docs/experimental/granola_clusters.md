## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325°F without convection. Spray inside bottom and sides of 13-by-9-inch metal baking pan with vegetable oil spray.
2. In large bowl,  combine rolled oats, wheat germ, flax seeds, and chia. Toss with a flexible spatula to combine, then stir in buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla. Cover with plastic and set aside until oats are stiff and dry, about 20 minutes (the chia will look a little fuzzy, but that's normal). Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt, cover, and let stand until the mixture looks loose and damp from the dissolved sugar, about 30 minutes. 
3. Add rice krispies and pumpkin seeds to bowl, and stir until well combined.
4. Transfer mixture to greased baking pan and use rubber spatula to spread mixture into even layer. Use rubber spatula to press down firmly on oat mixture until mixture is very flat.
5. Place baking pan in oven. Bake until uniformly golden brown and dry to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.
6. Use oven mitts to remove baking pan from oven. Place baking pan on cooling rack and let granola cool completely in pan, about 45 minutes.
7. Use your hands to break cooled granola into bite-size pieces. Serve. (Granola can be stored at room temperature in airtight container for up to 6 weeks.)
