<img src="URL" alt="DESCRIPTION" width="320"/>  

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è info
* About 4 hours  
* 4 servings  

## üìã ingredients
- [ ] **908  grams** pork belly
- [ ] **10  cm** unpeeled ginger, sliced
- [ ] **2  whole** green onion
- [ ] **6  whole** eggs

- [ ] **1200  grams** dashi
- [ ] **120  grams** sake
- [ ] **90  grams** mirin
- [ ] **100  grams** honey
- [ ] **120  grams** soy sauce

## üî™ steps
1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. Pound 908 g pork belly on both sides with a meat pounder (or the back of the knife) to tenderize it.
1. Press and mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands. Then, cut the pork belly into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. My pieces are roughly 1¬Ω x 1¬Ω x 2 inches (4 x 4 x 5 cm).
1. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When it‚Äòs hot, add the meat **fat side down** on the ungreased skillet. Cook the meat until all sides are nicely browned. To prevent oil splatter, you can use a splatter screen. **Tip:** Searing the surface of the meat before boiling helps draw out excess fat and lock in the flavor.
1. When the meat is nicely browned, transfer the pieces to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat.
1. Cut the unpeeled ginger thinly into 18‚Äì20 slices ginger; **set aside half of the slices for later.** Next, cut the **green part of** 2 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Set aside the white part to make *Shiraga Negi* later for garnish (see below).

#### To Cook the Pork Belly
1. In a large pot, put the seared pork belly, green part of the negi, and half of the sliced ginger (**saving the other half for the braising liquid**). Next, add enough water to the pot to cover the meat. **Tip:** Boiling the seared meat removes the excess fat and scum.¬†These two steps (searing and boiling) remove excess fat while keeping the meat juicy.
1. Bring it to a boil over high heat, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, uncovered (so the unwanted odor goes away), for **2‚Äì3 hours**. Turn the pork occasionally during this time. When the liquid is running low, add more water or hot water to the pot so the meat remains covered at all times. **Tip:** If you want really tender meat, cook for at least 3 hours.

#### To Prepare the Eggs and Shiraga Negi
1. Meanwhile, hard-boil 6 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and peel them. Set aside. For more details, see my post on How To Make Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs.
1. Next, use the **white part of** 2 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) to make shiraga negi. First, cut the white part into pieces that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Then, make a lengthwise incision to remove the soft green core (save for another use). Stack the outer layers, holding them flat against the cutting board, and slice lengthwise into very thin julienned strips. Soak in a bowl of iced water for 10 minutes to remove the bitterness, and drain well. Set it aside to use later as a garnish. **Tip:** For step-by-step photos, see my tutorial on How To Make *Shiraga Negi*.

#### To Braise the Pork Belly
1. After cooking for 2 hours, drain the water and remove the pork to a paper towel to wipe off the excess oil.
1. To a large, heavy-bottomed pot (I use a Dutch oven), add the cooked pork belly, 1200 ml dashi (Japanese soup stock), 120 ml sake, and 90 ml mirin. Start cooking on medium heat.
1. Next, add 100 g sugar, 120 ml soy sauce, the **rest of the ginger slices,** and 2 dried red chili pepper. **Tip:** I remove the chili seeds so it won‚Äòt be too spicy for my kids.
1. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to **low or medium low** to maintain a simmer. Place an *otoshibuta* (drop lid) on top of the meat; do not cover the pot with the regular pot lid. Cook for **1 hour**. **Tip:** If you don‚Äòt have an otoshibuta, make one! See my post on How To Make *Otoshibuta*.
1. **After the halfway point** (cooking for 30 minutes), add the peeled hard-boiled eggs to the pot. You can now remove the otoshibuta.
1. Continue simmering, uncovered, for another 30 minutes. If the cooking liquid is pretty low, reduce the heat to **low** or lowest. Occasionally, baste the meat with the braising liquid and gently turn the meat and eggs. **Make sure there‚Äòs enough liquid in the pot so the pork and eggs don‚Äòt burn.** When the sauce is reduced and the meat has a nice glaze, it‚Äôs ready to serve.

#### To Serve
1. Serve the Kakuni and eggs and garnish with shiraga negi on top. Season with shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (optional) to taste.

#### To Develop Flavor (optional)
1. If you prefer a more flavorful and less oily Kakuni, wait one day before serving. Let it cool completely, then refrigerate the pork belly in its braising liquid overnight. The next day, remove and discard the solidified fat (optional) before gently reheating the Kakuni. Heat thoroughly and serve.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes
* You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3‚Äì4 days and in the freezer for a month.
