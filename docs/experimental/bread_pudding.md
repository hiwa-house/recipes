## 🔪 steps
1. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a gallon-sized zip-top bag. Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then chop into 1/2-inch cubes; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.
2. Measure 720 grams sliced apples into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, about 60-75 minutes. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.
3. While apples macerate, adjust oven racks to middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees.
4. Spread bread cubes in single layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Bake, tossing occasionally, until just dry, about 15 minutes, switching trays from top to bottom racks halfway through. Cool bread cubes about 15 minutes; set aside 2 cups.
5. Whisk egg yolks, whole eggs, granulated sugar, and vanilla together in large bowl. Whisk in cream and milk until combined. Add remaining 8 cups cooled bread cubes and toss to coat. Gently fold apple mixture into the bread mixture until well combined. Transfer mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking dish and let stand, occasionally pressing bread cubes into custard, until cubes are thoroughly saturated, about 30 minutes.
6. Spread reserved bread cubes evenly over top of soaked bread mixture and gently press into custard. Using pastry brush, dab melted butter over top of unsoaked bread pieces. Sprinkle pearl sugar *(or 1 tablespoon each of brown and granulated sugars)* evenly over top.
7. Place bread pudding on rimmed baking sheet, cover loosely with foil, and bake on middle rack for 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until custard has just set, and pressing center of pudding with finger reveals no runny liquid, 30 minutes more. (Instant-read thermometer inserted into center of pudding should read 170 degrees.) Transfer to wire rack and cool until pudding is set and just warm, about 45 minutes. Serve.

## ✏️ notes
* If you cannot find challah, a firm high-quality sandwich bread such as Arnold Country Classics White or Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Hearty White may be substituted.
