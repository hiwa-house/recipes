## 🔪 steps
1. Eight days before serving, combine salt, pink salt (or saltpeter), and brown sugar in a small bowl and whisk until homogeneous. Rub evenly over every surface of brisket. Combine peppercorns, mustard, coriander, allspice, cloves, ginger, and bay leaves and sprinkle evenly over both sides of beef, pressing spices gently into the meat until they stick. Seal the beef in a vacuum sealed bag or a zipper-lock bag with all of the air pressed out of it. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator and let rest for 7 days, flipping once a day.
2. ***To Cook in a Sous-Vide Cooker:*** The day before serving, remove beef from the bag and rinse off all spices under cold, running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Re-seal in a vacuum bag and cook at 180°F until tender, about 10 hours. Proceed to *step 4*.
3. ***To Cook in the Oven:*** The day before serving, remove beef from the bag and rinse off all spices under cold, running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 200°F. Place brisket in large Dutch oven, cover with water by several inches, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover with lid slightly ajar, place in oven, and cook until completely tender, about 10 hours. Proceed to *step 4*.
4. Once beef is cooked, transfer to an airtight container along with cooking liquid. Let rest in refrigerator at least overnight, and up to 3 days.
5. To serve, transfer cooking liquid to a large saucepan or Dutch oven along with carrots, potatoes, and cabbage. Top up with water until vegetables are submerged. Slice beef thinly against the grain and fan slices out in large skillet. Add 1 cup of liquid from pot to skillet and place skillet on top of pot. Cover skillet. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until vegetables are completely tender and beef is heated through, about 45 minutes.
