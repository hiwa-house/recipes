- [ ] **5	grams**	dark soy sauce *(1 tsp)*
- [ ] **15	grams**	Xiaoxing wine *(1 tbsp)*

## üî™ steps
1. Blanch chicken wings in boiling water for 20 seconds. The easiest and fastest way to do this is to use a hot water kettle, and to pour the boiling water onto the chicken wings in a large bowl in the sink (see video). This would save a lot of time compared to heating up a large pot of water over a stove. Drain the hot water, and run cool or ice water over the chicken.
2. Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, add white pepper, salt, scallion greens, and half of ginger. Then massage gently and let marinate for 15 minutes.
3. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the scallion whites, the rest of the ginger, garlic, and star anise to the pot and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the soy sauce, Xiaoxing wine, chicken broth, and rock sugar, scraping up any browned bits. Continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
4. Nestle the hard-cooked eggs and chicken, into the pot, adding more water if necessary to almost cover the wings, and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked and tender, about 30 minutes (190 to 195¬∞F on an instant-read thermometer), turning over the chicken and eggs halfway through cooking to ensure even coloring from the sauce.
5. Transfer the chicken and eggs to a serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while finishing the sauce. Remove and discard the star anise. Skim as much fat as possible off the surface of the sauce. Return the pot to medium heat and simmer until sauce reaches desired thickness, about 10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and eggs and serve.
