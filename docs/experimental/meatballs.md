## 🔪 steps  
1. In a heatproof measuring cup, sprinkle gelatin all over surface of stock and let stand for 5 minutes. Microwave stock, stirring once or twice, until gelatin completely dissolves, about 2 minutes. Pour stock into a wide heatproof bowl and refrigerate until fully set, about 30 minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine bread with buttermilk, tossing to coat. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until bread is completely moist, about 10 minutes. Mash bread to make sure there are no dry spots.
3. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add minced onion and cook, stirring, until onion is golden and tender, about 7 minutes.
4. Add ground pork, ground beef, onion, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic, egg, oregano, fennel, salt, and pepper to bread/buttermilk mixture. Finely mince gelled stock and add. Set mixer bowl in stand mixer and attach paddle. Starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high, beat mixture until ingredients are thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
5. Preheat broiler and set oven rack in upper position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Dipping your hands in water as needed to prevent meatball mixture from sticking, roll roughly tablespoon-sized portions of meatball mixture into balls slightly smaller than golf-ball size. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Broil meatballs until browned on top, about 7 minutes.
7. Heat tomato sauce in a medium pot until simmering and add meatballs. Simmer until meatballs are just cooked through and register about 145°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes.
8. Serve meatballs, spooning sauce all over and grating more cheese on top.

## ✏️ notes  
* Attempting to find an easy meatball recipe that passes the D test.
* Should be springy, yet tender.
* Toaster oven broiler doesn't cook fast enough.
* Meatballs fell apart in the sauce.
