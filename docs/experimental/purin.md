## 📋 ingredients  

**Caramel Sauce**  

- [ ] **50	grams**	sugar
- [ ] **15	grams**	water
- [ ] **15	grams**	boiling water

**Custard**  

- [ ] **400	mililiters**	milk

## 🔪 steps  

**Caramel Sauce**  

1. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and room temperature water for the caramel. Turn on the heat to medium low and let the sugar dissolve completely, swirling occasionally, but without stirring.
2. When the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to medium. Swirl the saucepan to mix, but do not use a utensil, as it may cause the sugar to crystallize.
3. As the sugar begins to caramelize, it will slowly turn amber, and the small bubbles will become larger.
4. When the sugar reaches desired caramel color, turn off the heat, and immediately pour a little bit of the hot water into the caramel pot. The mixture will boil vigorously and sputter, but once this has subsided, add the rest of the hot water, swirling to combine.
5. Quickly pour the caramel sauce into the molds, aiming for a thin, 3 mm caramel layer.  

**Custard**  

1. Place milk in a microwave safe container and microwave until 140°F.
2. Add the egg, remaining sugar, and vanilla into a mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly.
3. Add warm milk into the egg mixture gradually and stir to combine them all together.
4. Strain the custard base using a sieve or strainer.
5. Divide and pour the custard mixture into the 4 ramekins over the caramel.
6. Place the molds into a frying pan or dutch oven and add water until it reaches halfway up the ramekins.
7. Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to low, wrap the pan lid in a dry towel and put the lid on and leave it for simmer for 3-5 minutes, or until the custard sets.
8. Turn off the heat and leave the ramekins covered in the pan for 15 minutes.
9. Remove the ramekins from the pan and allow to cool.
10. Serve at room temperature or chilled for at least 1 hour.

## ✏️ notes  
* Cooking times for the custard will vary based on heat settings and pudding mold sizes.
