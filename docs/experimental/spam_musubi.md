## ℹ️ info
* About 20 minutes  
* 8 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **30	grams**	shoyu *(2 tbsp)*
- [ ] **25	grams**	light brown sugar *(2 tbsp)*
- [ ] **10	grams**	vegetable oil *(2 tsp)*
- [ ] **340	grams**	Spam, cut horizontally into 8 slices *(1 can)*
- [ ] **3	sheets**	roasted sushi nori
- [ ] **5	cups**	cooked short-grain white rice

## 🔪 steps
1. In a small bowl, whisk the shoyu and sugar. Set aside.
2. Lightly coat the bottom of a large skillet with oil and heat over medium. Fry the Spam slices until evenly browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Turn off the heat. Working quickly to avoid burning, add the soy mixture and turn the Spam slices until evenly coated in glaze. Immediately transfer the Spam slices and glaze to a plate.
3. To mold the musubi, start by placing a strip of nori, rough side up, on a cutting board or clean work surface. Place a Spam musubi maker mold over it, in the middle, then place a slice of Spam into the mold. Fill the mold with a generous mound of rice. Press the rice firmly with the musubi maker press or with your hands until it is 3/4-inch thick, adding more rice as needed.
4. Use the press to hold the rice down with one hand and pull the mold upward to unmold the musubi with your other hand. Wrap the nori around the Spam-rice stack, bringing both ends of the strip to the middle, folding one over the other, and flipping it over so the seam is down and the Spam is facing up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately or wrap with plastic wrap to take with you on the go.

## ✏️ notes
* To reduce fat and salt, place sliced Spam in boiling water for 5 minutes, then pat dry and proceed with the recipe.
