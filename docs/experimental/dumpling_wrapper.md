## ℹ️ info  
* About 90 minutes  
* 60 wrappers  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **477	grams**	all purpose flour
- [ ] **253	grams**	water, boiling

## 🔪 steps  
1. Add the flour to the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly drizzle in the water while whisking with a dough whisk and mix until the dough looks shaggy and dry. By hand, press dough into a ball. Rest for 20 minutes.
2. Knead the dough with a dough hook in a stand mixer until completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover bowl and rest for at least 30 minutes.
3. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Uncover dough and transfer to counter. Roll dough into 18-inch cylinder and cut cylinder into 6 equal pieces, about XX grams each. Set 5 pieces aside and cover. Roll remaining piece into 8-inch cylinder. Cut cylinder in half and cut each half into 5 equal pieces, about 12 grams each. Place dough pieces on 1 cut side on lightly floured counter and lightly dust with flour. Using bench scraper, press each dough piece into 2-inch disk. Cover disks with damp towel.
4. With a small rolling pin, roll 1 disk from the edge to the center, turning a quarter turn each time. Continue until the wrapper is 9 cm round and re-cover disk with damp towel. Repeat with remaining disks.
5. Working with 1 wrapper at a time (keep remaining wrappers covered), place scant 1 tablespoon filling in center of wrapper. Brush away any flour clinging to surface of wrapper. Pleat as desired and pinch together to seal. Gently press dumpling into crescent shape and transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling in bowl.

## ✏️ notes  
* Dough is 53% hydration.
