## ℹ️ info
* About 90 minutes  
* 60 wrappers  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **475	grams**	all purpose flour
- [ ] **252	grams**	water, boiling

## 🔪 steps
1. Add the flour to the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly drizzle in the water while whisking with a dough whisk and mix until the dough looks shaggy and dry. By hand, press dough into a ball. Rest for 20 minutes.
2. Knead the dough with a dough hook in a stand mixer until completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover bowl and rest for at least 30 minutes.
3. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Uncover dough and transfer to counter. Roll dough into 18-inch cylinder and cut cylinder into 6 equal pieces, about 120 grams each. Set 5 pieces aside and cover.
4. With pasta roller, roll dough through each setting, ending at setting #5. Lightly dust countertop with corn starch and lay rolled dough on countertop. Using a 9 cm biscuit cutter, cut wrappers, stack on a plate, and cover. Repeat with remaining dough pieces.
5. Working with 1 wrapper at a time (keep remaining wrappers covered), place scant 1 tablespoon filling in center of wrapper. Pleat as desired and pinch together to seal. Gently press dumpling into crescent shape and transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling in bowl.

## ✏️ notes
* Dough is 53% hydration.
