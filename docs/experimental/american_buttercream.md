## ℹ️ info
* About 15 minutes  
* 2 cups  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **230	grams**	unsalted butter, softened to about 65°F *(2 sticks)*
- [ ] **100	grams**	organic powdered sugar, preferably tapioca-based
- [ ] **140	grams**	light corn syrup *(7 tbsp)*
- [ ] **10	grams**	vanilla extract *(2 tsp)*
- [ ] **1	grams**	Diamond Crystal kosher salt *(1/4 tsp)*
- [ ] **60	grams**	heavy cream, straight from the fridge *(2 oz)*
- [ ] Other extracts or gel-paste food coloring

## 🔪 steps
1. Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, then sift the powdered sugar on top. Fit the machine with a paddle attachment, and mix on low until the powdered sugar is fully incorporated. Add the corn syrup in 3 to 5 additions, pausing along the way to scrape the bowl and beater as necessary. Once all the corn syrup has been added, mix at the highest speed for two minutes.
2. Add vanilla and salt, then mix on medium until the frosting is airy and light, pausing along the way to scrape the bowl and beater as needed. During this time, the mixture will have warmed to approximately 70°F (21°C).
3. Reduce speed to low, then drizzle in the cream, a tablespoon at a time. When fully incorporated, pause to scrape the bowl and beater, then continue beating a few seconds more on medium speed. After each tablespoon, check the texture, stopping additions when desired texture is reached.
4. Add extracts or gel colors as desired. Switch to paddle attachment and mix on low until incorporated. Use buttercream right away or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out air, and seal. The buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to several months. Bring buttercream to approximately 72°F and re-whip before use.
