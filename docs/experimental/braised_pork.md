## üî™ steps  
1. Sear skin of pork belly until well-browned using a wok over medium-high heat, or by placing the pork in a shallow tray of water and torching over 2-3 passes.
2. Rinse pork in a bowl of water and scrape skin clean with a knife or stainless scrubber.
3. Place pork in a wok and add water to cover. Add half of ginger, half of green onion, and half of Xiaoxing wine to wok. Bring to a boil, skimming any foam, and cook until chopsticks can be inserted into the skin, about 20 minutes.
4. Transfer pork belly to a bowl of cold water. Rinse and wipe out wok. When cool, slice pork into 2 cm cubes. Set aside.
5. Heat wok over medium-high heat. Add oil and pork belly. Stir fry until golden brown, emptying any oil that accumulates, about 6 minutes.
6. Add star anise, cinnamon, bay, peppercorns, and remaining ginger to wok. Stir fry with pork belly until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add bean curd and soy sauce to wok, then add water to barely cover the pork. Add rock sugar, salt, and remaining Xiaoxing wine to wok and bring to a boil over high heat. Add eggs and remaining green onion, reduce to a bare simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pork belly is completely tender, about 60 minutes.
7. When the pork is tender, remove and discard aromatics. Remove eggs, set aside, and peel when cool. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced to a sticky glaze that coats the pork. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with the peeled eggs.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes  
* Technique is more red-braised style, but addition of bean curd is more Hakka kau yuk style.
