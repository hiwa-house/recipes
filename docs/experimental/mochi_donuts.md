## 🔪 steps  
1. **Doughnuts:** Whisk mochiko and tapioca starch in a small bowl to combine.
2. Bring milk, sugar, butter, and kosher salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Remove from heat, add dry ingredients, and stir with a wooden until a lumpy paste forms. (Mixture will be dry in spots and hard to combine, but don’t worry; this is normal.)
3. Transfer dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed to release some steam and cool slightly, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add egg and mix (still on medium speed) until combined, about 2 minutes. Add baking powder and mix until combined and dough is sticky but smooth, about 30 seconds. Place a piece of plastic directly on top of dough and let rest 15 minutes.
4. Pour vegetable oil into a large pot to come 2" up sides; fit pot with thermometer and heat oil over medium until thermometer registers 350°F.
5. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. To shape doughnut holes, lightly oil your hands and scoop out a tablespoon of dough (18 g per piece) and roll into balls. Place balls on prepared baking sheet.
7. Working in batches, lower dough balls into oil with a slotted spoon and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Carefully transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
8. **Glaze and assembly:** If using raspberries or black sesame seeds, finely grind with a mortar and pestle.
9. Whisk powdered sugar, 30 grams whole milk, kosher salt, and flavoring in a small bowl until smooth. (Glaze should be thick but pourable—like a yogurt drink. Thin with additional whole milk if needed.) Stir in vanilla extract if making the ube version.
10. Dip tops of doughnuts in glaze, letting excess drip back into bowl, and return to rack. Let sit until glaze is set, about 15 minutes.
