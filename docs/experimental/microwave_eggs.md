## ℹ️ info  
* About 10 minutes  
* 1 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **50 grams** large egg *(1)*
- [ ] **120 grams** dashi, chicken broth, or water *(1/2c)*
- [ ] **pinch** kosher salt
- [ ] ***Your toppings of choice***
	* shoyu
	* chili oil
	* chives
	* green onion
	* cilantro
	* fried shallots

## 🔪 steps  
1. In a small, microwave-safe shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, dashi and salt until very well combined, at least 30 seconds. Skim off any bubbles with a spoon or pop them by blowing on them.
2. Cover the bowl with a microwave-safe plate and microwave at 500 watts (50% power on a 1,000-watt microwave) until the eggs have just set and are no longer liquid in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Let sit in the microwave to cool slightly, then carefully remove, uncover and drizzle with the sauce, and garnish with toppings, if using. Serve immediately.

## ✏️ notes  
* Can be scaled at a ratio of 1 part egg to 3 parts liquid.  
* Every microwave differs, so check for doneness at 5 minutes, then in 30-second intervals after that if needed.
