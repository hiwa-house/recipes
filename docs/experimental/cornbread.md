## ℹ️ info
* About 60 minutes  
* 12 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **85	grams**	cornmeal
- [ ] **213	grams**	flour
- [ ] **105	grams**	granulated sugar
- [ ] **11	grams**	baking powder
- [ ] **3	grams**	kosher salt
- [ ] **69	grams**	vegetable oil
- [ ] **42	grams**	butter, melted
- [ ] **100	grams**	eggs *(2 large)*
- [ ] **296	grams**	milk

## 🔪 steps
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease an 8X8- or 9X9-inch baking pan (I always use metal; glass pans will bake differently).
2. For the cornbread, in a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the oil, butter, eggs, and milk and stir with a whisk or rubber spatula until just combined. The batter will be runny.
3. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
4. For the honey butter, whip all the ingredients together with an electric mixer. Best served at room temperature so it is soft and spreadable.

## ✏️ notes
* You can make these into muffins by using the same temperature and check at around 17-18 minutes.
