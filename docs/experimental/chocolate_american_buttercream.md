## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **40	grams**	Dutch cocoa powder, sifted *(6 tbsp)*
- [ ] **80	grams**	hot water, boiling *(6 tbsp)*
- [ ] **240	grams**	chocolate chips, semi-sweet *(1 1/4 c)*
- [ ] **240	grams**	chocolate chips, dark *(1 1/4 c)*
- [ ] **450	grams**	unsalted butter, softened to about 65°F *(4 sticks)*
- [ ] **80	grams**	organic powdered sugar, preferably tapioca-based
- [ ] **1	grams**	Diamond Crystal kosher salt *(1/4 tsp)*

## 🔪 steps
1. In a small bowl, add Dutch cocoa powder to boiling water. Whisk until smooth. Set aside and cool to approximately 75°F.
2. Add the chocolate chips to a heat-proof bowl. Microwave on 50% power at 30-second intervals. Stir between every heating step. Repeat this process until 75% of the chocolate is melted, then stir until all the chocolate is melted. Set aside and cool to approximately 85°F.
3. Place butter in the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit stand mixer with a whisk attachment and mix on high speed until the butter is creamy and pale. This will take about 3 minutes. Add the melted chocolate and mix on medium-low until fully incorporated. Pause to scrape the bowl and beater, then resume mixing for 3 minutes. Add the cocoa powder paste and mix on medium-low until fully incorporated. Pause to scrape the bowl and beater, then resume mixing for an additional 3 minutes.
4. Add powdered sugar and salt, then increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is creamy and smooth, pausing along the way to scrape bowl and beater as needed.
5. Switch to the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until creamy and smooth, approximately 3 minutes. Use buttercream right away or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out air, and seal. The buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to several months. Bring buttercream to approximately 72°F and re-whip before use.
