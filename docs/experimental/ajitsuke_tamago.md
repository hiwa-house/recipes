## ℹ️ info
* About 15 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **4	whole**	eggs
- [ ] **60	grams**	soy sauce
- [ ] **60	grams**	mirin
- [ ] **60	grams**	sake *(or water)*
- [ ] **4	grams**	granulated sugar *(or honey)*

## 🔪 steps
1. **Prepare Marinade:** In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and 1 tsp sugar. Heat until sugar is dissolved, then set aside to cool completely.
2. **Soft-boiled Eggs:** Find a lidded saucepan large enough to allow your eggs to comfortably fit on the bottom in a single layer. Add 1 inch of water, cover and bring to a boil.
3. Gently lower eggs into the saucepan. Cover pan and cook eggs, adjusting the burner to maintain a gentle boil, 7-1/2 minutes for a translucent, fudgy yolk.
4. Transfer eggs to a towel and allow them to cool naturally, or shock them in iced water for 15 minutes. Once the eggs are cool, carefully peel eggs under cold running water.
5. **Marinate Eggs:** Transfer the eggs to a plastic bag and pour marinade on top until eggs are covered. Remove the air from the bag and store in a bowl to ensure that eggs are completely submerged.
6. Refrigerate at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours. Discard marinade. Store eggs in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Soak the bag in hot water or place egg in broth to reheat.
