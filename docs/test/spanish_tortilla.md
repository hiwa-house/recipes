## ℹ️ info  
* About 15 minutes  
* 4-6 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **28	grams**	extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] **170	grams**	potato chips *(6oz)*
- [ ] **12	large**	eggs
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## 🔪 steps  
1. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until frothy and lightened in color, about 4 minutes.
2. Add 30ml olive oil to a 10-inch nonstick skillet and heat over medium until oil is shimmering.
3. Add the chips to the eggs. Using a plastic spatula, gently fold a few times to ensure chips are coated. Let the chips soak for 5 minutes, until the chips absorb the eggs.
4. Add egg/potato chip mixture and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, for 10 seconds. Shake pan to evenly distribute mixture, then even out top with spatula. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until tortilla is mostly set but still wet on top, about 2 minutes.
5. Place a large metal or glass pot lid over tortilla. Using kitchen towels to grip lid and pan handle, carefully invert entire tortilla so that it's resting on top of pan lid. Slide tortilla back into skillet so that the cooked side is now facing up. Use spatula to tuck down edges and create an even disk shape. Continue to cook, shaking occasionally, until tortilla is golden brown on second side and barely cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Slide tortilla out onto a cutting board.
6. Dust with paprika and cut into squares. Serve immediately, or allow to cool and serve at room temperature.

## ✏️ notes  
* Can be served with aioli.
