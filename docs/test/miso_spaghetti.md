## steps  
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.

2. Coat the tomatoes and garlic with 27g/30ml of the olive oil on a baking sheet. Roast the tomatoes until they start to burst and turn a light golden brown, rotating the pan halfway through during cooking, 25 to 30 minutes.

3. Remove the sheet from the oven and transfer the tomatoes and all the drippings from the pan to a blender. Blend until it turns into a smooth pur√©e. Add the miso paste and goat cheese. Pulse in the blender until combined.

4. To cook the spaghetti, add the pasta, 750 ml water, and 1 tsp salt to a large saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Cook for about 12 minutes, or until tender. Drain the pasta in a strainer and transfer back to saucepan. Save a portion of the pasta cooking water.

5. Add the roasted tomato sauce and fold. Over high heat and adding 60ml of pasta cooking water at a time, stir until combined and emulsified. Remove from heat.

6. Serve the pasta warm, dividing between 3 bowls. Garnish each bowl of pasta with parmesan and basil.
