## iron pan seasoning
Blue paper shop towels are designed to soak up oil. To season steel cookware, wash and dry well, put in the oven at 200Â°F for 1/2 hour. Take out of oven and, using a regular paper towel, coat with just enough (animal) fat to be on the surface of the pan. (This is the only time you are going to put fat on the pan.) Wipe off excess fat with a blue paper towel. Back into the oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and blue towel it, again. Return to the oven set to 300Â°F, wait 30 minutes, remove and blue towel it. Return to the oven set to 400Â°F, wait 30 minutes, remove and blue towel it. I use the same blue towel for the whole seasoning pass.Return to the oven set to 500Â°F, wait 30 minutes, turn off the oven and let it cool down inside of the oven.
