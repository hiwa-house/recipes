## 🔪 steps
1. Bring water, bouillon, and reserved trimmings to simmer in Dutch oven over high heat. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain vigorous simmer and stirring occasionally, until all liquid evaporates and trimmings begin to sizzle, about 20 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until dark fond forms on bottom of pot, 2 to 4 minutes longer.
2. Add onion, carrot, celery, garlic, wine, bay leaf, and water to boil in 12-quart stockpot over medium-high heat, skimming fat or foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 2 hours, continuing to skim surface as necessary. Add parsley and thyme; continue to simmer until stock is rich and flavorful, about 2 hours longer, continuing to skim surface as necessary.
3. Strain stock through large-mesh strainer into large container; remove meat from strained solids and set aside; discard solids in strainer. Immediately reserve 940 grams of stock for gravy. With remaining stock, cool slightly, about 20 minutes; spoon fat from surface. Cool stock to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate stock and meat.
4. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is deep golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and slowly whisk in strained stock. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

## ✏️ notes
* Stock portion makes ~2250 ml total and leaves ~1320 ml extra *(Fills 2x 24 oz canning jars)*.
* You can store gravy in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days or frozen for up to 2 weeks. Reheat, either in the microwave (at 70% power and stirring every one minute) or in a saucepan over low heat (whisking often).
* Lumps can be strained or blended out, an overly thick gravy can be thinned with a little stock or water, and an overly thin one can be thickened by simmering.
