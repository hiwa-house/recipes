## ℹ️ info  
* About 18-24 hours *(30 minutes active)*  
* XX servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **1	large**	banana leaf
- [ ] **1	whole**	bone-in or boneless pork butt *(5-7 lbs)*
- [ ] **9	grams**	Hawaiian salt
- [ ] **15	grams**	liquid smoke

## 🔪 steps  
1.  Place pork on banana leaf. Season with salt, making sure to rub it on all sides.
2.  Loosely wrap banana leaf around pork, and place pork shoulder in a sous vide–safe vacuum-sealer bag. Add liquid smoke and seal bag.
3.  Set precision cooker to 165°F. When the water bath is at temperature, add sealed bag with pork. Allow to cook for 18 to 24 hours. After this stage, pork can be refrigerated for up to 1 week before continuing.
4.  Transfer pork to a large bowl, and transfer liquid to a large measuring cup. Using a ladle, skim off excess fat and discard. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred with two forks. Add reserved liquid until desired texture is reached. Season to taste with more salt or liquid smoke. Serve.

## ✏️ notes  
* For oven method, after step 1, wrap pork in banana leaf, place in Dutch oven, and cook at 300°F until pork reaches an internal temperature of 195º to 200ºF, about 5 hours.
* If making ahead to serve over the course of several meals, store pork and reserved liquid separately, adding liquid only to the portion you are serving immediately.
