## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Preheat oven to 275°F. Spread bread evenly over rimmed baking sheet. Bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating tray and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven temperature to 375°F.
2. In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, about 2 minutes. Add sausage and break up into small pieces. Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in poultry seasoning, fennel, and up to 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper to taste. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, add chicken stock, and scrape up any browned bits.
3. Whisk milk, eggs, and 1 tablespoon parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into herb and vegetable mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed. Let mixture stand for at least 15 minutes before baking, occasionally pressing bread to soak up custard.
4. To cook, cover dutch oven with lid, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove lid and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve. 

## ✏️ notes
* The stuffing can be prepared through step 3, placed in a buttered 8x8 baking dish, and covered a day in advance. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the stuffing to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before baking the next day.
