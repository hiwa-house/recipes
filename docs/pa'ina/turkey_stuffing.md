## 🔪 steps
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat convection oven to 250°F. Arrange bread evenly on rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, then stir bread to redistribute. Return sheet to oven and continue to bake until bread is light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Let cool completely, then transfer to large bowl. Increase oven temperature to 350°F.

2. In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat until foaming subsides, about 2 minutes. Add sausage, onions, and celery to pot, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, breaking up meat, until vegetables are soft and beginning to brown and sausage is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in sage, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with bread.

3. Whisk milk, eggs, and 1 tablespoon parsley in a large bowl. Add stock and whisk again until homogeneous. Add custard to bread mixture and fold to combine. Let sit for 10 minutes. Fold again and let sit until broth is fully absorbed. Transfer to 13 by 9-inch baking dish and distribute evenly but do not pack down. 

4. To cook, cover dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil, increase oven temperature to 375°F, and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 15 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.

## ✏️ notes
* The stuffing can be prepared through step 2 a day in advance. Cooled bread can be stored in a zipper-lock bag, and sausage mixture can be refrigerated. Remove mixture from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before baking the next day.
