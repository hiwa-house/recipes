## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **500	grams**	onions, roughly chopped *(3 medium)*
- [ ] **12	sprigs**	fresh thyme
- [ ] **45	grams**	kosher salt
- [ ] **18	grams**	granulated sugar
- [ ] **4	grams**	black pepper
- [ ] **1800	grams**	bone-in turkey thighs and/or drumsticks *(4 lbs)*
- [ ] **200	grams**	duck fat
- [ ] **1/2	teaspoon**	granulated garlic, divided
- [ ] **2	whole**	bay leaves, divided

## 🔪 steps
1. Process onions, thyme sprigs, salt, sugar, and pepper in blender until finely chopped, scraping down sides as needed. Combine mixture with turkey in a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 days.
2. Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 153°F in tall pressure cooker pot. Remove turkey from onion mixture and rinse well. Pat turkey dry with paper towels.
3. Place turkey in single layer in bags. Add fat, granulated garlic, and bay leaves divided evenly between the bags. Seal bag and gently lower into prepared water bath until turkey is fully submerged. Weigh down bag if necessary.
4. Cover container with plastic wrap and cook for 24 hours or up to 30 hours. Remove bag from water bath and let cool completely, about 1 hour. When cool, remove thighs from their bags, reserving cooking liquids.
5. ***(If refrigerated after cooking,)*** using sous vide circulator, bring water to 140°F in tall pressure cooker pot. Fully submerge bags in water bath and cook for at least 1 1/2 hours.
6. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500°F. While oven heats, crumple 20-inch length of aluminum foil into loose ball. Uncrumple foil, place in rimmed baking sheet, top with wire rack, and spray wire rack with oil. Using tongs, gently transfer thighs, skin side up, to prepared wire rack, being careful not to tear delicate skin. Set aside. Strain liquid through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl. Working in batches, pour liquid into fat separator, letting liquid settle for 5 minutes before separating fat from turkey stock.
7. Transfer thighs to oven and roast until well browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer thighs to cutting board, skin side up, and let rest until just cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.
8. Flip 1 thigh skin side down. Using tip of paring knife, cut along sides of thighbone, exposing bone. Carefully remove bone and any stray bits of cartilage. Flip thigh skin side up. Using sharp chef's knife, slice thigh crosswise 3/4-inch thick. Transfer to serving platter, skin side up. Repeat with remaining thighs. Serve, passing gravy separately.

## ✏️ notes
* Buy and butcher whole turkeys. Save breasts for turkey tinga tacos.
* Recipe may be started up to 2 weeks before serving.
