## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **500	grams**	onions, roughly chopped *(3 medium)*
- [ ] **12	sprigs**	fresh thyme
- [ ] **45	grams**	kosher salt
- [ ] **18	grams**	granulated sugar
- [ ] **1 1/2	teaspoons**	black pepper
- [ ] **1800	grams**	bone-in turkey thighs and/or drumsticks *(4 lbs)*
- [ ] **200	grams**	duck fat (or other mixture of chicken, olive, or vegetable oil)
- [ ] **1/2	teaspoon**	granulated garlic
- [ ] **2	whole**	bay leaves

## 🔪 steps
1. Process onions, thyme sprigs, salt, sugar, and pepper in blender until finely chopped, scraping down sides as needed. Combine mixture with turkey in a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag. Refrigerate for 2 days. Massage turkey at least every day.
2. Using sous vide circulator, bring about 6 quarts water to 152 degrees in heatproof container. Remove turkey from onion mixture and rinse well. Pat turkey dry with paper towels.
3. Place turkey in single layer in bag. Add fat, granulated garlic, and bay leaves. Seal bag and gently lower into prepared water bath until turkey is fully submerged. Weigh down bag if necessary.
4. Cover container with plastic wrap and cook for at least 16 hours or up to 20 hours. Remove bag from water bath and let cool completely, about 1 hour. When cool, remove thighs from their bags, reserving cooking liquids.
5. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500°F. While oven heats, line rimmed baking sheet with foil, and top with wire rack. Using tongs, gently transfer turkey, skin side up, to prepared wire rack, being careful not to tear delicate skin.
6. Transfer thighs to oven and roast until well browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven, arrange on a platter, tuck fresh herbs between pieces, and serve.

## ✏️ notes
* For 2023, buy and butcher whole turkeys. Save breasts for turkey tinga tacos.
* Recipe may be started up to 2 weeks before serving.
* After cooking, turkey may be refrigerated in sealed bag until ready to sear and serve.
