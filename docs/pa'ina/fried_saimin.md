## üî™ steps  
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, arrange the Spam in a single layer and cook until crispy and browned on all sides, about six minutes.
3. Remove the Spam from the pan and set aside.
4. Add three tablespoons of the oil to the pan. Scramble eggs, seasoning with garlic salt and white pepper to taste, and fry undisturbed, until cooked through. Remove the eggs to a cutting board. Once the eggs are cooled, slice into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
5. Place the cabbage in a colander and set the colander in the sink.
6. Loosen the noodles and add to the boiling water. When the water returns to a boil, the noodles should be nearly done (two to three minutes; or follow the package directions). Check the noodles by taste or touch. They should be tender but springy.
7. Drain the noodles over the bean sprouts in the colander. Let both drain thoroughly.
8. While the noodles are still warm, in a large bowl, whisk together the remaining three tablespoons of oil, the shoyu, oyster sauce, dashi powder and a pinch of white pepper.
9. Add the noodles and bean sprouts and toss to coat with the sauce. Transfer the noodle/sprout mixture to a serving bowl or individual bowls and garnish with the Spam, sliced eggs, kamaboko, and scallions.
10. Serve with a small dish of hot mustard, drizzled to taste with shoyu. If desired, serve with a cup of saimin broth.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes  
* Don't boil more than 1 lb of fresh noodles at a time. Noodles will not cook evenly.
