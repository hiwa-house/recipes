## 🔪 steps
1. **For the Slaw Mix:** Combine cabbage, onion, carrot, and parsley in a large bowl, leaving plenty of room to toss (you may have to use two large bowls if your bowls are not large enough). Sprinkle with ***154 grams*** of sugar and ***70 grams*** of salt and toss to combine. Let rest five minutes, then transfer to a large colander and rinse thoroughly under cold running water.
2. Transfer rinsed mixture to a salad spinner and spin dry. Alternatively, transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet lined with a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel and blot mixture dry with more paper towels. Return to large bowl and set aside.
3. **For the Dressing:** Combine ***52 grams*** of sugar, vinegar, oil, black pepper, mustard, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and garlic in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous.
4. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, sugar, and/or vinegar if desired.
