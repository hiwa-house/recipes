## ℹ️ info
* About 30 minutes  
* 56 pigs  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **2	cans**	refrigerated crescent rolls *(8 oz, x2)*
- [ ] **56	whole**	cocktail sausages or hot dogs *(14 oz, x2)*

## 🔪 steps
1. Heat oven to 325°F. Gently unroll the dough so each perforated sheet stays intact. Pinch the seams together so it’s a solid sheet of dough. Using a pizza cutter, cut each sheet in half. Then, cut each half into 7 triangles. Repeat with other sheet of dough.
2. Place sausage on wide end of each triangle. Roll up each towards the tip; place point side down on 2 ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake 14 minutes or until golden brown, switching position of cookie sheets halfway through baking. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.
