## ℹ️ info
* About 60 minutes  
* 2 pints  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **454	grams**	zucchini *(1 medium)*
- [ ] **120	grams**	small yellow onion *(1 small)*
- [ ] **22	grams**	kosher salt *(2 heaping tbsp)*
- [ ] **3	whole**	ice cubes
- [ ] **500	grams**	apple cider vinegar *(2 c)*
- [ ] **206	grams**	granulated sugar *(1 c)*
- [ ] **5	grams**	mustard seeds, crushed *(1 1/2 tsp)*
- [ ] **3	grams**	turmeric *(1 tsp)*
- [ ] **1	grams**	crushed red pepper flakes *(1/8 tsp, optional)*

## 🔪 steps
1. With a mandolin, cut zucchini lengthwise (or crosswise, if you prefer) in 1/16-inch slices. Cut onion crosswise the same thickness.
2. Place zucchini and onion in a low wide bowl, toss with salt and cover with ice water. Add a few ice cubes. Leave for 1 hour, until faintly salty and slightly softened when tasted. Drain, discard ice and dry vegetables thoroughly between kitchen towels. Rinse and dry bowl.
3. Make the brine: Combine vinegar, sugar, dry mustard, mustard seeds and turmeric in a nonreactive saucepan, and simmer over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes. Turn off heat and set aside until just warm to the touch.
4. Return zucchini to the bowl and pour cooled brine over, then stir to distribute spices.
5. Transfer mixture and brine to pint jars and refrigerate for at least a day before serving.
