## üî™ steps  
1. In a large bowl, toss cucumbers generously in kosher salt.
2. Arrange cucumbers in a single layer on paper towels or clean kitchen towels to allow salt to draw moisture out of cucumbers. Let sit for 90 minutes, then rinse cucumbers thoroughly.
3. Sterilize a 1-quart jar, along with their lids and rings, and keep hot until ready to fill with pickling mixture.
4. In a medium, non-reactive saucepan over medium-high heat, bring vinegar, water, and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil.
5. Evenly layer the cucumbers with the onion, garlic, tarragon, peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves in the jar.
6. Pack cucumbers into the jar, leaving 1/2-inch of headspace.
7. Fill jars with hot vinegar mixture, leaving 1/4-inch headspace from the top of the jars.
8. Tap jars to remove any air bubbles, cap jars, and process them for 10 minutes in a boiling-water canner.
9. Cool jars and store in a cool, dark place for 3 weeks before opening.
