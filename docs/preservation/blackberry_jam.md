## ℹ️ info  
* About XX minutes  
* 10 jars  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **2.5	kilograms**	blackberries, just-ripe berries with some under-ripe berries as well *(6-7 pints)*
- [ ] **1.25	kilograms**	sugar
- [ ] **90	grams**	lemon juice, from 2 lemons
- [ ] **1/4	teaspoon**	ground cinnamon

## 🔪 steps  
1. Soak berries in large mixing bowl for 20 minutes to clean and drive off insects.
2. Drain berries, mix everything together in a large steel pot or other jam-making vessel. Let berries macerate for 2 hours.
3. After macerating, partially mash berries with potato masher. Optional, process half of berries through food mill to remove excess seeds.
4. Cook berries on medium-high heat, stirring very frequently, until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring just enough to prevent scorching on bottom of pot, until berries are foamy, about 10 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring more frequently and lowering temperature as foam begins to subside, 10 to 20 minutes longer. Cook until most of the fruit is disintegrated and bubbles have slowed down and become glossy, about 10 more minutes (times can vary depending on fruit). Blackberry jam is done when temperature reaches 220°F.
5. Test for doneness: Turn off heat and set a small spoonful of jam in the freezer for 5 minutes. Jam is done once it holds together and doesn't run off the spoon when tilted; if jam is too runny, return to low heat and continue to cook, stirring frequently and repeating doneness test every 5 minutes, until jam passes test.
6. Heat water in large stock pot to 180°F. While water is heating, sanitize canning jars and lids with StarSan.
7. Fill jars with blackberry jam, leaving ¼" headspace. Wipe rims, and screw on lids until snug.
8. Place jars in stock pot, and top with additional water to cover jars. Bring pot to a boil, and process jars for 5 minutes.

## ✏️ notes  
* Ideal sugar content of 60-65 brix.
