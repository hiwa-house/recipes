## ℹ️ info
* About 6 hours total  
* 12-16 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **1000	grams**	boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
- [ ] **4	whole**	bay leaves
- [ ] **6	whole**	thyme sprigs
- [ ] **2	whole**	shallots, very roughly chopped
- [ ] **4	cloves**	garlic, split in half
- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] Freshly ground nutmeg, to taste
- [ ] Vegetable oil, lard, or duck fat, as needed

## 🔪 steps
1. Combine pork, bay leaves, thyme sprigs, shallots, and garlic in a large bowl. Season lightly with kosher salt and toss to combine. Transfer contents to a vacuum bag and seal.
2. Use a sous vide immersion circulator to preheat a water bath to 185°F. Add bag to water bath and cook for 8 hours. If bag floats, weigh it down or use a heavy-duty binder clip to attach a metal spoon or knife to bottom of bag as a weight.
3. When meat is cooked, remove from water bath. Transfer contents of bag to a large bowl. Pick out chunks of meat with a set of tongs and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Reserve drained fat and juices.
4. Turn mixer on to low speed and gradually increase speed to medium, allowing pork to break down and shred. Slowly drizzle in the fat and juices a few tablespoons at a time, tasting in between each addition until the mixture is as loose and creamy as you like it. Season to taste aggressively with salt (the mixture will get blander as it chills, so add salt until it almost tastes too salty).
5. Carefully pack mixture into jars, spooning it in a little bit at a time and making sure to remove all air bubbles. Smooth tops of mixture with the back of a spoon, wipe rims of jars with a clean cloth, then pour a quarter inch of vegetable oil, lard, or duck fat on top of each one. Close lids and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to a week before serving. Serve lightly chilled with bread or crackers and cornichons, whole grain mustard, and fruit preserves. Rillettes can also be frozen directly in their jars and held for several months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight before serving.
