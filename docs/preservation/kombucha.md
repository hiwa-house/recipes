## ℹ️ info
* About 168 hours *(15 mins active)*  
* 5 pints  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **1000	grams**	filtered or distilled water, boiling
- [ ] **70	grams**	sugar
- [ ] **7	grams**	loose leaf tea
- [ ] **100	grams**	jasmine or green tea kombucha starter

## 🔪 steps
1. ***For the First Fermentation:*** In a large jar, combine water with the sugar, stirring to help fully dissolve sugar. Off heat, stir in tea leaves and let steep for preferred amount of time, or approximately 12 minutes. Remove or strain tea leaves and discard, then let cool until tea registers 85 to 90°F.
2. Stir in kombucha starter until well distributed. If desired, gently place SCOBY on top (you should have at least 2 inches of headspace in the jar after adding the SCOBY). The SCOBY may float or sink to bottom of jar; either is normal.
3. Cover jar with a double layer of coffee filters or fine mesh cloth and secure with a rubber band. Store in a dark area between 70 and 80°F and let ferment until kombucha tastes sour and small bubbles rise to surface, about 7-10 days (pH should register roughly 2.9 - 3.5 on a pH meter).
4. ***For the Secondary Fermentation:*** Using clean hands, remove SCOBY and place on plate. Stir kombucha with a wooden spoon, making sure sediment is evenly dispersed. Then, using clean and sanitized twist-cap or flip-top glass bottles fitted with a funnel, fill each with kombucha; make sure to leave 1 to 1 1/2 inches of headspace in each bottle (reserving at least 200 grams of kombucha to be used as starter for your next batch). Seal bottles and store in a dark area between 70 and 80°F until beverage reaches desired level of carbonation, 3 days to 2 weeks. Check one bottle periodically to monitor carbonation: it is ready when you see small bubbles rising fairly rapidly to the top, even when capped; if using twist caps, the cap will pop up slightly when a good level of carbonation is reaches; if using flip-top bottles, you may need to open one bottle to check the carbonation, resealing if there isn't enough fizz. When kombucha has reached desired level of carbonation, move bottles to refrigerator and store for up to 8 weeks.
5. ***To Continue Brewing Future Batches of Kombucha:*** Repeat Steps 1 through 4 using the leftover kombucha as starter along with reserved SCOBY.

## ✏️ notes
* Starter tea can either be from a prior batch (preferred) or from a bottle of store-bought kombucha. Use an unflavored jasmine or green tea kombucha if possible. For best results, use jasmine or green tea kombucha from a previous batch.  The best source of a SCOBY is a friend or acquaintance who regularly brews kombucha. You can also buy them commercially, but note that SCOBY's that are sold dry or unsubmerged in starter liquid tend to perform weakly in comparison to those sold fresh and packaged in starter tea.
