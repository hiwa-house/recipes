Cook for 5 minutes.

2. Transfer soup to the jar of a blender. Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high (be careful starting up, it can shoot out the top of the blender — open the vent and hold a kitchen towel over the lid to prevent blowout). With blender running on high, gradually trickle in unsalted butter.
3. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into individual serving bowls and serve with  grilled cheese sammies.

## ✏️ notes  
* Kroger-brand crushed peeled tomatoes in tomato puree is preferred.
* *Better Than Bouillon* chicken base and water used in place of chicken stock.
