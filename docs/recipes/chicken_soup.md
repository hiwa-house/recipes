## steps  
1. For the Broth: Combine all ingredients in small pressure cooker and cover with cold water, at least 2 quarts (1.9L). Close cooker and bring to high pressure, then cook for 45 minutes. Allow cooker to depressurize. Skim fat and impurities from stock, then strain broth into a new pot and discard the solids.

2. For the Soup: Add chicken, vegetables, and pasta to the broth. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is as cooked as you like it, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the herbs, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

## notes  
* For a Western-style soup, dice soup ingredients, add dried pasta, and use thyme, rosemary, and/or parsley as aromatics.  
* For a Chinese-style soup, thinly slice soup ingredients, add Napa cabbage, rice cakes and/or dumplings, and use cilantro, ginger, green onion and basil as aromatics.
