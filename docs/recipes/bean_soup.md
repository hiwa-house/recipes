## 🔪 steps  
1. Heat olive oil in a medium pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and dried red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add beans, ham, bay leaves, kosher salt, bouillon, and water. Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover and cook at high pressure for 2 minutes. Allow normal pressure release.
3. Remove lid and discard bay leaves. Add kale and bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is tender, about 15 minutes longer.
4. Season to taste with additional salt and black pepper and serve immediately in bowls, drizzling with extra-virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sherry vinegar. Serve with crusty bread.

## ✏️ notes  
* Adapted for pressure cooker.
* *Better Than Bouillon* chicken base used in place of chicken stock or water.
