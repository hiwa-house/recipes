## info  
* About 20 minutes  
* 15 pancakes (8-inch)  

## ingredients  
```
2 large eggs
240 mililiters whole milk
90 grams all-purpose flour
21 grams melted butter, plus more for cooking
⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon sugar
½ teaspoon vanilla
```

## steps  
1. **For the Batter:** Combine eggs, milk, flour, melted butter, salt, sugar, and vanilla in a blender. Start blender on low speed and increase to high. Blend until smooth, about 10 seconds. (Alternatively, you can combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously until smooth.) Batter can be made ahead and stored for up to 2 days.
2. **To Cook:** Heat a 8-inch nonstick or carbon steel skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Lightly grease with butter, using a paper towel to wipe out the excess.
3. Hold the pan's handle in one hand and pour in 45ml batter, swirling and tilting pan immediately to spread batter in a thin, even layer over bottom of pan.
4. Let cook until edges begin to brown and pancake is slightly browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Using a thin metal or nylon spatula, lift one edge of pancake and flip. Cook on second side for 60 seconds, then transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Fill and top pancakes as desired (such as with jam, berries, applesauce, maple syrup, or yogurt) and serve.
