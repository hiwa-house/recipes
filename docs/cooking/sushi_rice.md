## ℹ️ info
* About 90 minutes
* 5 servings

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **4	cups**	sushi rice
- [ ] water
- [ ] **110	grams**	rice vinegar
- [ ] **85	grams**	honey
- [ ] **5	grams**	kosher salt
- [ ] **1	piece**	kombu

## 🔪 steps
1. Put the rice in a sieve over a bowl and wash the rice with cold tap water. Rinse the rice and discard the water immediately. Repeat this process 2 times.
2. Refill the bowl with cold water, and use your hands to remove the excess starch by using a gentle rubbing motion. After 4 more water changes, or when the water is mostly clear, drain the rice.
3. Transfer the rice into rice cooker, add water, and let the rice soak. After 30 minutes, cook under "Sushi" setting.
4. While rice cooks, place a kitchen towel in the hangiri and fill with water. To make sushi vinegar, combine rice vinegar, honey, salt, and kombu in a small glass measuring cup and heat in microwave at 50% power, whisking occasionally until the sugar is completely dissolved. Set aside to let it cool.
5. When the rice is cooked, empty hangiri and drain thoroughly. Transfer the cooked rice into hangiri and spread out evenly using a rice paddle.
6. Aim a fan set to low directly at rice. Carefully sprinkle vinegar mixture over rice by drizzling it over the back of the rice paddle. Combine the rice and vinegar by gently folding it in with a cutting motion, being careful not to crush any rice grains. Continue fanning rice and folding until rice stops steaming and grains have achieved a slightly glossy texture that just sticks together when you squeeze them.
7. Keep sushi rice at room temperature covered in a clean damp dish towel.
