## 🔪 steps  
1. Adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Spread chickpeas on top and roll around under your hands to thoroughly dry. Transfer chickpeas to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, and paprika. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard paper towels and line baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread chickpeas over foil and transfer to oven. Roast on upper rack, shaking pan occasionally, until chickpeas are about 3/4 their original size with a dense, nutty texture, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool slightly.
2. Meanwhile, add kale to now-empty chickpea bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and massage kale until well-coated in oil. Set aside at room temperature.  
3. Place pine nuts in a skillet and transfer to lower rack of oven. Toast, stirring occasionally, until pine nuts are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer to a bowl. Set aside.
4. In a medium bowl, combine sun-dried tomatoes, scallion whites, garlic, lemon juice, zest, hot sauce, vinegar, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir well with a fork.
5. When chickpeas are cooked and slightly cooled, add to bowl with kale. Add pine nuts, sun-dried tomato dressing, cilantro, and scallion greens. Toss with hands until well-combined. Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, and/or lemon juice as necessary.

## ✏️ notes  
* The massaged kale with sun-dried tomato vinaigrette keeps very well in the fridge, retaining its crunch and developing flavor over a couple days. Before serving, add the roasted chickpeas, pine nuts, and cilantro. Toss gently until well-combined.
