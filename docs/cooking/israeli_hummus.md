## ℹ️ info
* About 60 minutes, plus overnight soak
* about 4 cups

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **225	grams**	dried chickpeas
- [ ] **9	grams**	baking soda *(2 tsp)*
- [ ] **3	grams**	Diamon Crystal kosher salt *(1 tsp)*
- [ ] **1	whole**	bay leaf
- [ ] **4	clove**	garlic, unpeeled
- [ ] **80	grams**	lemon juice *(from 2 lemons)*
- [ ] **200	grams**	tahini
- [ ] **60	grams**	ice water, plus more as needed
- [ ] **1	grams**	ground cumin *(1/2 tsp)*
- [ ] *extra-virgin olive oil, for serving*

## 🔪 steps
1. Place chickpeas, 2 tablespoons salt, and 1 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover by 2" (6 cups). Cover and let sit at room temperature until chickpeas have doubled in size, 8–12 hours. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
2. Combine soaked chickpeas, bay leaf, and remaining 1 teaspoon baking soda in large pressure cooker and add cold water to cover (4 cups). Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming surface as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, seal pressure cooker, and cook at pressure until beans are completely tender, to the point of falling apart, 20 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally, drain (reserving cooking liquid), and set aside.
3. Combine garlic and lemon juice in a blender. Pulse until a pulpy puree is formed, about 15 short pulses. Let sit 10 minutes to allow garlic to mellow. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer set over a large bowl. Press out as much liquid as you can with the back of a spoon or a rubber spatula, then discard solids.
4. Return garlic-lemon liquid to blender. Add tahini paste and pulse to combine. With blender running, slowly drizzle in ¼ cup ice water (it may seize up at first) until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick.
5. Add hot chickpeas and cumin and turn the blender to the lowest possible speed and slowly increase speed to high. If the mixture becomes too thick to blend, add cooking liquid until it has the texture of a very thick milkshake, always starting the blender on low speed before increasing to high. Continue blending until completely smooth, about 2 minutes.
6. Season to taste with salt, more lemon juice, and more cumin as desired. Transfer to a sealed container and allow to cool to room temperature. It should thicken up until it can hold its shape when spooned onto a plate.
7. Serve hummus on a wide, shallow plate, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with za'atar, paprika, whole warm chickpeas, and/or chopped parsley. Leftover hummus can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Allow to come to room temperature before serving.
