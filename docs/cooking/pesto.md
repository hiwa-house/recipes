## ℹ️ info
* About 30 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **10	grams**	garlic cloves *(2 whole)*
- [ ] **30	grams**	pine nuts
- [ ] **35	grams**	basil leaves, washed with water still clinging to the leaves
- [ ] Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- [ ] **30	grams**	grated Parmigiano Reggiano
- [ ] **15	grams**	grated Pecorino Fiore Sardo
- [ ] **144	grams**	mildly flavored extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] ***SERVING IDEAS:***  
	* dried pasta
	* peeled Yukon Gold potatoes
	* green beans, stems trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths on a bias

## 🔪 steps
1. Using a marble mortar and wooden pestle (see note), pound the garlic to a paste.
2. Add pine nuts and continue to crush with pestle, smashing and grinding them, until a sticky, only slightly chunky, beige paste forms.
3. Add basil leaves a handful at a time and pound and grind against the walls of the mortar. Add pinch of salt with each handful to act as an abrasive. Continue until all basil leaves have been crushed to fine bits.
4. Add both cheeses, then slowly drizzle in olive oil, working it into the pesto with the pestle until a fairly smooth, creamy, emulsified sauce forms. Add more oil, if desired.
5. Pesto can be served with pasta right away or transferred to a jar or container, covered with a thin layer of olive oil, and sealed and refrigerated overnight.
6. **Serving Idea:** In a large pot of salted boiling water, boil pasta, potato, and green beans until pasta is al dente and potato and green beans are very tender. Drain, reserving cooking water, and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add pesto sauce to pasta along with cooking water. Toss well to emulsify into a creamy sauce.

## ✏️ notes
* Best is a marble mortar and a large olivewood pestle. In a pinch, granite or other stone with a broad-headed pestle will work.
* Mortar should be able to hold at least one liter.
