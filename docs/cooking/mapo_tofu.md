## üî™ steps
1. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Heat sichuan peppercorns in a large wok over medium heat until lightly smoking. Transfer to a mortar and pestle. Pound until finely ground and set aside.
2. Slice tofu in half horizontally. Then, slice down to get strips, and finally cut in the other direction to get cubes. Add tofu to the saucepan of boiling water. Simmer gently for 1 minute. Remove from heat until ready to stir fry.
3. Whisk baking soda, kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon water together in a small bowl. Add pork to baking soda mixture and, using your hand, toss to combine.
4. Heat oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add ground sichuan peppercorns. Add minced meat and cook, stirring constantly until meat begins to crisp around edges (about 1 minute).
5. Lower heat to medium-low. Add garlic and ginger, cooking until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add chili bean paste and cook until oil becomes red, about 90 seconds. Add paprika, wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock and bring to a boil.
6. Gently drain water from tofu, being careful not to break up the tofu. Add tofu to wok and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Combine corn starch and cold water in a small bowl, mix with a fork until homogenous. Pour one-third of corn starch mixture into the sauce and cook for 30 seconds until thickened, stirring gently. Repeat with remaining thirds of slurry.
8. Transfer immediately to a serving bowl and serve immediately with white pepper, remaining toasted ground Sichuan pepper, and chili flakes as desired.
