## 🔪 steps
1. Place pinto beans, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover (800 grams). Cover and let sit at room temperature until beans have doubled in size, 8–12 hours. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
2. Combine soaked pinto beans, half of onion, garlic, Mexican oregano, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in small pressure cooker and add cold water to cover (800 grams). Bring to a boil over high heat, seal pressure cooker, reduce heat to low, and cook at pressure until beans are falling apart, 30 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally, discard bay leaves, drain (reserving cooking liquid), and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat fat until shimmering over medium heat. Add minced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in beans and cook over high heat for 2 minutes. Add 200 milliliters of reserved bean-cooking liquid. Using stick blender, process to make a smooth purée. Thin with more bean cooking water until desired consistency is reached. If refried beans become too wet, simmer, stirring, until thickened, as needed. Season with salt and serve.
