## ℹ️ info  
* About 60 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **227	grams**	dried pinto beans *(1/2 c)*
- [ ] water
- [ ] **142	grams**	white onion, 1/2 minced, 1/2 roughly chopped *(1 medium)*
- [ ] **2	cloves**	garlic, crushed
- [ ] **1	tablespoon**	Mexican oregano
- [ ] **2	whole**	bay leaves
- [ ] **1	whole**	jalapeño, stem removed and sliced in half *(optional)*
- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] **56	grams**	lard, bacon drippings, or vegetable oil *(1/4 c)*

## 🔪 steps  
1. Place pinto beans, 1 tablespoon salt, and ½ teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover (800 grams). Cover and let sit at room temperature until beans have doubled in size, 8–12 hours. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
2. Combine soaked pinto beans, chopped onion, garlic, Mexican oregano, bay leaves, and jalapeño (if using) in small pressure cooker and add cold water to cover (1000 grams). Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming surface as needed. Seal pressure cooker, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at pressure until beans are completely tender, to the point of falling apart, 30 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally, discard bay leaves, drain (reserving cooking liquid), and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat lard, bacon drippings, or oil until shimmering over medium-high heat. Add minced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in beans and cook for 2 minutes. Add 60 mililiters of reserved bean-cooking liquid. Using stick blender, process to make a smooth purée. Thin with more bean cooking water until desired consistency is reached. If refried beans become too wet, simmer, stirring, until thickened; if they become too dry, add more bean-cooking liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Season with salt and serve.
