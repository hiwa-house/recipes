## 🔪 steps
1. Place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. Cover the chickpeas by several inches of water, then bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent overflow, for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, their skins are falling off, and they’re quite soft. In a fine-mesh strainer, drain the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, add garlic and salt to mortar and pestle and crush the garlic to a paste. Add the lemon juice and mix with the paste, then let the mixture rest, 10 minutes or longer.
3. Transfer garlic and lemon juice mixture to a large bowl. Add the tahini and whisk until the mixture is thick and creamy.
4. While whisking, drizzle in ice water 1 tablespoon at a time. Whisk until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy. Add the cumin and whisk until incorporated.
5. Add the tahini sauce and the drained, over-cooked chickpeas to a blender. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon and blend to achieve a smooth, loose, and creamy texture, about 2 minutes. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste.
6. Scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. Top with garnishes of your choice, and serve. Leftover hummus keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.
