Cook for 10 minutes.

1. Using an immersion blender, blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to medium. With blender running, gradually trickle in unsalted butter.
2. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into individual serving bowls and serve with grilled cheese sammies and saltine crackers.

## ✏️ notes
* Kroger-brand crushed peeled tomatoes in tomato puree is preferred.
* *Better Than Bouillon* chicken base and water used in place of chicken stock.
