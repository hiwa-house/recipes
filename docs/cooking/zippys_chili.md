## üî™ steps  
1. Heat oil in medium pressure cooker over medium-high heat, until shimmering. Add about 1/4 of the ground beef, stirring occasionally, until very well browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove browned beef from cooker and set aside. Drain all but 1 tablespoon fat from cooker.
2. Add onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of cooker, until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. (Add more oil at any time if cooker seems too dry.) Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened, about 1 minute.
3. Return browned beef to cooker along with any accumulated juices. Add uncooked beef, cream of mushroom soup, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir well to combine. Stir in chocolate and fish sauce. Add bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, stirring well and scraping bottom all over. Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, break up any chunks of ground beef. Scrape bottom all over once more before sealing the cooker.
4. Seal cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 20 minutes. Quick-release cooker and stir chili well, scraping bottom to make sure nothing is sticking.
5. Discard bay leaf. Stir in drained beans. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Taste chili and add more chili powder to taste, if desired. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. If chili is too thick, stir in some reserved bean-cooking liquid to thin to desired consistency. If chili is too thin, simmer until thickened to desired consistency.
6. Serve with the toppings of your choice.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes  
* To cook dried red kidney beans:
	1. Before making the chili, add 130 grams dried red kidney beans to medium pressure cooker and cover with 3 inches of water.
	2. Season with salt, add 1/2 split onion, 2 medium cloves garlic, 1 dried bay leaf, and a sprig or two of fresh thyme or rosemary (if desired). Bring to high pressure, cook for 22 minutes, then release pressure naturally.
	3. Transfer cooked beans to a container, leaving them in their cooking liquid until ready to use. Clean pressure cooker before making chili.
