## üî™ steps  
1. Whisk 30 grams water, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl until dissolved. Using a hand, whisk beef with mixture until thoroughly combined.
2. Heat oil in medium pressure cooker over medium-high heat, until shimmering. Add onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add beef and cook, stirring with wooden spoon to break meat up into 1/4-inch pieces, until beef is browned and fond begins to form on pot bottom, 12 to 14 minutes.
3. Stir in chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. (Add more oil at any time if cooker seems too dry.) Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened, about 1 minute. Add cream of mushroom soup, crushed tomatoes, fish sauce, bay leaf, and water. Stir well to combine.
4. Bring to a simmer, stirring well and scraping bottom all over. Seal cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 20 minutes. Quick-release cooker and stir chili well, scraping bottom to make sure nothing is sticking.
5. Discard bay leaf. Stir in drained beans. Season with salt, plenty of black pepper, and more chili powder to taste. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. If chili is too thick, stir in some reserved bean-cooking liquid to thin to desired consistency. If chili is too thin, simmer until thickened to desired consistency.
6. Serve with Redondo's Hawaiian Winner and rice.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes  
* To cook dried red kidney beans:
	1. Before making the chili, add 130 grams dried red kidney beans to medium pressure cooker and cover with 3 inches of water.
	2. Season with salt, add 1/2 split onion, 2 medium cloves garlic, 1 dried bay leaf, and a sprig or two of fresh thyme or rosemary (if desired). Bring to high pressure, cook for 22 minutes, then release pressure naturally.
	3. Transfer cooked beans to a container, leaving them in their cooking liquid until ready to use. Clean pressure cooker before making chili.
