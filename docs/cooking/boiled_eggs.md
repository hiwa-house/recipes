## ‚ÑπÔ∏è info
* About 15 minutes  
* 12 servings  

## üìã ingredients
- [ ] **12	whole**	eggs

## üî™ steps
1. Find a lidded saucepan large enough to allow your eggs to comfortably fit on the bottom in a single layer. Add 1 inch of water, cover and bring to a boil.
2. Gently lower eggs into the saucepan. Cover pan and cook eggs, adjusting the burner to maintain a vigorous boil, 6 minutes for a warm liquid yolk and firm whites, 8 1/2 minutes for a translucent, fudgy yolk, or 11 minutes for a yolk that is firm all the way through.
3. Transfer eggs to a towel and allow them to cool naturally. Eat immediately, or store in the refrigerator for up to a week directly in their shell.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes
* You can cook as many eggs as will fit in a single layer in your pot, up to around a dozen.
* If you have trouble with eggs cracking during cooking, use a pushpin to poke a small hole through the shell on the fat end of the eggs. (This can also help minimize the dimple that forms on the cooked egg white due to an internal air pocket.)
* Serving Ideas:
	* Press hard-boiled eggs through the large holes of a box grater and add them to chopped salads, or use as a topping for grilled vegetables dressed with a vinaigrette.
	* For egg salad, use a couple of boiled eggs, a dollop of mayo, diced celery and red onions (or sliced scallions), a squeeze of lemon juice and zest, and some minced fresh parsley or chives, all squashed together between my (clean) fingers in a bowl.
	* If you‚Äôre cooking fresh or instant ramen, add a precooked soft or medium-boiled egg (either still in the shell or peeled) directly to the boiling noodle water for the last 90 seconds of cooking, which warms the egg back up. Peel under cool running water, split in half, and garnish your noodles with it.
	* Stir a couple of refrigerator-cold, soft-boiled eggs into a bowl of very hot rice (I usually microwave day-old rice for this) with a dash of soy sauce and a pinch of salt. Beat the mixture with chopsticks until the whites are broken into small chunks and the yolks have coated the rice in a creamy sauce for a heartier take on Japanese tamago kake gohan. Sprinkle with crushed nori or furikake.
