## ℹ️ info
* About 20 minutes  
* 1-2 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **100	grams**	large eggs *(2 whole)*
- [ ] **200	grams**	water, warmed to 100°F-140°F
- [ ] **1	gram**	kosher salt *(1/8 tsp)*
- [ ] **8	grams**	chicken bouillon *(1 tsp)*
- [ ] **3	grams**	sesame oil *(1/2 tsp)*
- [ ] ***TOPPING IDEAS:***  
	* light shoyu
	* chili crisp
	* green onions
	* crispy ground pork

## 🔪 steps
1. Beat the eggs lightly in a mixing bowl with a whisk, then slowly add the water while continuing to whisk. Add kosher salt, chicken bouillon, and sesame oil, then beat until thoroughly mixed, about 1 minute. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a heatproof bowl. Use a torch or heat gun to evaporate any bubbles on the surface.
2. Fill medium pressure cooker with about 2 inches of water and add steamer rack, then bring to a gentle boil. Place bowl with eggs mixture into pot and cover with bamboo steamer lid. Let it steam over low heat for 12 minutes, until the egg mixture sets *(If a spoon can be rested on the surface, egg is set)*. Turn off the heat, and let it sit for 5 minutes to finish cooking with the residual heat.
3. Remove the bowl carefully, season with your preferred toppings, and serve immediately.

## ✏️ notes
* Chicken stock can be substituted with dashi.
