## 🔪 steps
1. Blanch chicken for 20 seconds by pouring boiling water onto the chicken in a large bowl. Drain the hot water, and run cold water over the chicken. Transfer chicken to a bowl, add white pepper, salt, scallion greens, and half of ginger. Massage thoroughly and let marinate for 15 minutes.
2. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the scallion whites, the rest of the ginger, garlic, and star anise to the pot and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the soy sauce, Xiaoxing wine, chicken broth, and rock sugar, scraping up any browned bits. Continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
3. Nestle the hard-cooked eggs and chicken into the pot, adding water to almost cover the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked and tender, about 30 minutes (190 to 195°F on an instant-read thermometer), turning over the chicken and eggs halfway through cooking to ensure even coloring from the sauce.
4. Transfer the chicken and eggs to a serving dish, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while finishing the sauce. Remove and discard the star anise. Skim fat from surface of the sauce. Return the pot to medium-high heat and simmer until sauce reaches desired thickness, about 10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and eggs and serve.
