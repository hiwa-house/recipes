## ‚ÑπÔ∏è info
* About 45 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## üìã ingredients
- [ ] **454	grams**	beef chuck (80% lean)

- [ ] **4	whole**	soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- [ ] **4	slices**	good melting cheese

## üî™ steps
1. **Grind *(Optional)*:** Place feed shaft, blade, and 1/4-inch die of meat grinder in freezer until well-chilled. Meanwhile, place meat chunks on rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between each piece and place in freezer for 10 minutes until meat is firm, but not frozen. 
2. Grind meat and refrigerate immediately until ready for use. Handle as gently as possible.
3. **Form the Patties:** Line a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, trimmed into 4 equal squares. Divide the ground beef into 4 even balls (113g each). Working with one ball at a time, massage the meat gently in your hands until it is cohesive and tacky, about 15 seconds. Next, using clean hands, roll each into a smooth ball. Place the balls on the baking sheet, one ball in the center of each parchment quadrant.
4. Lay a second sheet of parchment (trimmed into 4 equal pieces) on top, then place a second rimmed baking sheet on top of the first. Press down very firmly on the baking sheet, pressing directly over each patty in turn, to spread each ball into a thin patty that is wide enough that it will extend at least a full inch around your burger buns on all sides. Refrigerate the patties until ready to cook.
5. **Cook the Patties:** When ready to cook, gently peel the top sheet of parchment off the burgers and season them generously with salt and pepper. Replace the top parchment, flip the parchment sheets with the burgers in between them over entirely, then peel off the other piece of parchment, which will now be on top. Season burgers generously with salt and pepper on the second side.
6. Using your hands or a spatula, carefully lay the patties on the grill over the hottest part of the flame and remove the parchment. If using charcoal, leave the lid open. If using gas, keep the lid closed as much as possible. Let cook, undisturbed, until the patties are well charred and juices start to pool on their top surfaces, about 1 minute.
7. Carefully flip the patties. (There will most likely be flare-ups; this is OK.) Add a slice of cheese, if using, to each, and continue to cook until the meat is just barely cooked through, about 15 seconds.
8. Transfer the patties to the buns and serve immediately.

## ‚úèÔ∏è notes
* These burgers will cook very quickly, so prepare your buns with toppings and condiments as desired.
* Placing any vegetables on the bottom bun makes the burger more stable and allows them to absorb juices that may drip from the patties.
