## ℹ️ info  
* About 150 minutes  
* 6-8 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **1400	grams**	sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch slices *(3 lbs)*
- [ ] **80	grams**	extra-virgin olive oil, divided *(3 oz)*
- [ ] **4	cloves**	garlic, minced
- [ ] **1/2	cup**	fresh thyme leaves
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] **19	grams**	maple syrup or agave nectar *(1 tbsp)*

## 🔪 steps  
1. Place cut sweet potatoes in freezer for 1 hour.
2. Transfer sweet potatoes to large bowl. Toss with 40 grams olive oil, garlic, thyme, red pepper flakes, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Line full sheet pan with aluminum foil, and spread sweet potatoes on two rimmed baking sheets. Adjust oven racks to upper middle and lower middle positions and set oven to 300°F.
3. Roast sweet potatoes for 50 minutes (or until beginning to brown and a thin skewer meets no resistance). Increase oven temperature to 450°F and carefully flip potatoes with thin offset spatula. Roast until second side is browned and potatoes are fully tender, about 30 minutes longer.
