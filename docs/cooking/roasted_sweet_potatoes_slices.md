## ℹ️ info  
* About 150 minutes  
* 6-8 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **1400	grams**	sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch slices *(3 lbs)*
- [ ] **80	grams**	extra-virgin olive oil, divided *(3 oz)*
- [ ] **4	cloves**	garlic, minced
- [ ] **1/2	cup**	fresh thyme leaves
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] **19	grams**	maple syrup or agave nectar *(1 tbsp)*

## 🔪 steps  
1. Transfer sweet potatoes to large bowl. Toss with 40 grams olive oil, garlic, thyme, red pepper flakes, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread sweet potatoes on rimmed baking sheet and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
2. Place cut sweet potatoes on sheet pan and cover with foil. Place in freezer for at least 1 hour.
3. Adjust oven racks to lower middle position, place sheet pan into oven, and set oven to 300°F. Roast until a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets no resistance, about 1 hour.
4. Remove foil, increase oven temperature to 425°F, and carefully flip potatoes with thin offset spatula. Roast until potatoes are browned and sugars begin to caramelize, about 30 minutes longer.
4. Transfer roasted potatoes to a large bowl. Toss with remaining olive oil and maple syrup *(or agave nectar, if using)*. Serve immediately.
