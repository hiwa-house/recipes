## ℹ️ info  
* About 210 minutes  
* 8-12 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **7-10	pounds**	bone-in half ham, packing intact *(3.2 - 4.5 kg)*
- [ ] **300	grams**	guava paste
- [ ] **120	grams**	water
- [ ] **80	grams**	cider vinegar

## 🔪 steps  
1. Preheat sous vide cooker to 140°F. Add ham and cook for at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours. Meanwhile, heat guava paste and water in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add the cider vinegar, standing back as you add it. Reduce to a bare simmer and continue to cook until mixture is thick and syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
2. 45 minutes before serving, adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 500°F. After preheating for 15 minutes, remove ham from water bath, remove packaging, and place cut side down on a rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Wipe surface dry with paper towels and brush with glaze.
3. Place in oven and roast for 5 minutes. Pull out oven rack, apply another coat of glaze, and repeat. Repeat glazing step 2 more times. Remove ham from oven and let rest 5 minutes.
4. To carve ham, place cut side down on a cutting board and make a single slice right next to the bone, dividing ham in two. Place boneless side with the newly cut side facing down and slice thinly into serving pieces. Repeat with remaining ham, cutting it from the bone one section at a time before slicing it into serving portions.

## ✏️ notes  
* Most hams come in thick vacuum-sealed packaging that can be used for sous vide cooking. If not, seal your ham in a vacuum-sealed bag before cooking it sous vide.
