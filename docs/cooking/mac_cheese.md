## ℹ️ info
* About 15 minutes  
* 3 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **200	grams**	elbow macaroni
- [ ] **185	grams**	evaporated milk *(1/2 can)*
- [ ] **185	grams**	medium cheddar cheese *(35 mm)*

## 🔪 steps
1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover (540 g). Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.
2. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.
