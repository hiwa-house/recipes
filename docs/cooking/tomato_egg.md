## ℹ️ info
* About 15 minutes  
* 3 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **300	grams**	eggs *(6 large)*
- [ ] **10	grams**	fish sauce
- [ ] **30	grams**	butter
- [ ] **6	grams**	cornstarch
- [ ] **60	grams**	cold water
- [ ] **40	grams**	vegetable oil
- [ ] **4	whole**	green onion, chopped, green parts reserved seperately
- [ ] **570	grams**	tomatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks *(5 Roma or 1 pint cherry)*
- [ ] Kosher salt and ground white pepper
- [ ] **18	grams**	ketchup
- [ ] **4	grams**	honey

## 🔪 steps
1. In a large bowl, beat the eggs very thoroughly with a whisk until completely smooth. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl, stirring with a fork until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add half of the cornstarch slurry, the fish sauce, and the butter to the eggs and beat to incorporate.
2. Heat the wok over high heat until smoking, then add half of the oil. Add the egg mixture and cook, pushing and folding the eggs with a spatula, until they are about half cooked. Transfer eggs back to large bowl and set aside.
3. Wipe out the wok and heat over high heat until smoking, then add remaining oil. Add the scallion whites and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Add the tomatoes, a pinch of salt, a pinch of white pepper, the ketchup, and the honey and cook, stirring, until the tomatoes break down and release their juices but still have some of their shape, about 2 minutes. Stir the remaining cornstarch slurring and add it to the wok.
4. As soon as the sauce has thickened, add the half-cooked egg mixture and cook, folding and occasionally stirring gently, until the eggs are set and the sauce is silky, rich, and no longer watery, about 1 minute. Fold in the scallion greens, season to taste with salt and white pepper, transfer to a serving bowl, and serve immediately with rice.
