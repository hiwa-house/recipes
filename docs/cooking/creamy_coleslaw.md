- [ ] **60	grams**	white onion, sliced thinly *(1/2 small)*
- [ ] **28	grams**	kosher salt

## 🔪 steps
1. ***Salt:*** In a large strainer or colander, mix the cabbage, carrot, and onion with the salt and put it in the sink or over a bowl for an hour. The salt will draw out a lot of water that will otherwise dilute the dressing. Then rinse the mix with cold water to get rid of excess salt and pat dry. You can now hold it in the fridge for a day if you want.
2. ***Dress:*** Whisk together the dressing in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, and onion mix. Taste, adjust seasonings, cover and chill for at least 1 hour if possible before serving.
