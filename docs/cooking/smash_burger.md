<img src="https://www.sunset.com/wp-content/uploads/goldburger-smash-burger.jpg" alt="burger" width="320"/>  

## ℹ️ info  
* About 10 minutes  
* 1 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **1	whole**	soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted
- [ ] **110	grams**	freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two equal balls
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- [ ] **1	slice**	good melting cheese

## 🔪 steps  
1. Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.
2. Preheat griddle over medium-high heat. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.
3. Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits. 
4. Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve. 

## ✏️ notes  
* These burgers cook very fast, so it's best to make them one at a time. If making multiple burgers, keep them warm under a tent of foil while preparing subsequent burgers.
