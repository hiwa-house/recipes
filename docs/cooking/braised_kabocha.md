## ℹ️ info  
* About 60 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## 📋 ingredients  
- [ ] **454	grams**	kabocha
- [ ] **425	grams**	water
- [ ] **6	grams**	katsuobushi  
- [ ] **14	grams**	sugar
- [ ] **30	grams**	sake

## 🔪 steps  
1. In a small pot, boil water. Once boiling, add katsuobushi, and set aside for 15 minutes.
2. Strain the katsuobushi with a fine-mesh strainer.
3. Cut the kabocha into equal 2” (5 cm) pieces.
4. In a large pot, place the kabocha pieces in a single layer, skin side down.
5. Add dashi, sake, and sugar. Cook on medium high heat and bring to a boil.
6. Add soy sauce and a pinch of salt. If the liquid does not cover 3/4 of kabocha, add water. Bring to a boil again.
7. Once boiling turn down to low heat to maintain the simmer. Cover with an otoshibuta (drop lid) and cook for 15 minutes, or until there is no resistance when pierced with a knife.
10. Remove from the heat and let kabocha sit covered until cool, about 30 minutes. Serve at room temperature or reheat before serving.
