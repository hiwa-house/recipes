## üî™ steps
1. Combine stock, gelatin, tomato paste, soy sauce, anchovies or fish sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender and blend on high speed until homogeneous. Set aside.
2. In 4-quart pressure cooker, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to pressure cooker, working in batches if necessary (beef should fit in a single layer). Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.
3. Reduce heat, add mushrooms to pressure cooker, and cook, stirring, until liquid is released and mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes, lowering heat as necessary to prevent scorching. Add pearl onions and cook, without stirring, until well browned on one side, a few minutes longer.
4. Add carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook, turning occasionally, until all vegetables begin to brown, about 5 minutes.
5. Add wine or sherry, scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon, and cook until reduced by three-quarters, about 5 minutes. Add reserved stock mixture. Add potatoes.
6. Cut seared steaks into 1-inch chunks and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with flour. Add beef and any juices accumulated in the tray or plate to pressure cooker, along with bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir to combine, seal pressure cooker, and bring to high pressure. Cook for 12 minutes, then normal release pressure and open cooker. Using tongs, fish out and discard thyme and bay leaves.
7. Stir in peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper if necessary. Serve immediately, or let cool overnight or for up to 5 days and reheat to serve.
