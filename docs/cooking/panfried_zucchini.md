## ℹ️ info
* About 30 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **360	grams**	zucchini *(2 medium)*
- [ ] kosher salt
- [ ] **40	grams**	all-purpose flour
- [ ] **100	grams**	eggs *(2 whole)*
- [ ] **30	grams**	vegetable oil
- [ ] ***DIPPING SAUCE:***  
	* soy sauce
	* rice vinegar
	* roasted sesame seeds

## 🔪 steps
1. Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch slices and lay them out on a paper towel. Lightly salt each side and set aside.
2. Spread flour in a rimmed plate and set aside. In a shallow bowl, whisk eggs with a pinch of salt and set aside.
3. After 15-20 minutes, or until zucchini are softened and moisture is released, shake off excess moisture and dredge both sides in flour, one slice at a time.
4. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. One at a time, dip each slice in beaten egg and place in heated pan. Cook until lightly golden, about a minute depending on the thickness and heat level. Flip them over when the bottom edges turn lightly golden, and cook for another minute or so. Add more oil as necessary.
5. In a small sauce dish, combine dipping sauce ingredients in a 2:1:1 ratio. Serve fried zucchini immediately with the dipping sauce.
