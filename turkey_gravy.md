## info  
* About 45 minutes  
* 2 cups  

## ingredients  
```
1	small	carrot, peeled and chopped into rough ¼-inch pieces (about ½ cup)
1	small	rib celery, chopped into rough ¼-inch pieces (about ½ cup)
1	small	onion, chopped into rough ¼-inch pieces (about ¾ cup)
3	tablespoons	unsalted butter
43	grams	unbleached all-purpose flour
1000	mililiters	low-sodium chicken broth
1	teaspoon	soy sauce
2	bay leaf
2	sprigs	fresh thyme
5	whole	black peppercorns
Table salt and ground black pepper
```

## steps  
1. Heat butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat; when foaming subsides, add vegetables and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and well browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes. 
2. Add drippings from sous vide bags to broth. Whisking constantly, gradually add broth to flour roux; bring to boil, skimming off any foam that forms on surface.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns; simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Strain gravy through fine-mesh strainer into clean saucepan, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

## notes  
* You can store gravy in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. In most cases, it will reheat nicely, either in the microwave (make sure to stir every 30 seconds to one minute to heat it evenly and prevent a skin from forming) or in a saucepan over very gentle heat (stir or whisk often). If anything does go wrong, just remember that lumps can be strained or blended out, and an overly thick gravy can be thinned with a little stock or water. An overly thin one, conversely, can be thickened by simmering briefly with a little extra cornstarch slurry.
