## info  
* About 150 minutes  
* 6-8 servings  

## ingredients  
```
1.4	kilograms	sweet potatoes, whole and scrubbed (3 lbs)
6	cloves	garlic, crushed
4	slices	ginger, crushed
```

## steps  
1. Place sweet potatoes in freezer until frozen solid, at least 6 hours and up to 3 months.
2. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Wrap each frozen sweet potato in aluminum foil, adding aromatics, and seal tightly so that there are no loose seams. Place wrapped sweet potatoes on prepared baking sheet and place in oven. Set oven to 300°F. Roast until a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets no resistance, about 3 hours.
3. Remove baking sheet from oven and carefully unwrap potatoes; discard aromatics. Increase oven temperature to 450°F and return unwrapped sweet potatoes to oven. Roast until sweet potatoes are fragrant and sugars begin to caramelize, about 40 minutes. Let roasted sweet potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, then serve as desired.

## notes  
* Raw sweet potatoes can be kept frozen, unwrapped, for up to 3 months. Cooked and cooled sweet potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze the cooked potatoes, wrapped in plastic and foil, for up to 1 month.
